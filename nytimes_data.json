Many of the thriving areas are places where these technologically advanced companies and their employees cluster.\n\nIn what is surely a related pattern, Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution found that not only are there big differences in the productivity of different regions \u2014 how much economic output is generated per worker \u2014 but that the high-productivity regions are also pulling away from the low-productivity ones.\n\nThis body of work \u2014 focused on how differences in regional economies can explain broader challenges \u2014 is attracting more notice from economists and policymakers who have tended to look at things from a national perspective. They\u2019re realizing it may not be enough to worry about overall levels of G.D.P. or employment or wages, when those headline numbers can mask big problems.\n\n\u201cConvergence used to be the order of the day,\u201d said Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. \u201cNow if anything divergence is the order of the day. There\u2019s a lot more to understand, but at a minimum we need to start recognizing place as a legitimate construct in our thinking.\u201d\n\nMr. Summers, known for his work on macroeconomics, began arguing around the time of the 2016 election that economics researchers needed to start taking regional divides more seriously as a contributor to bigger problems. To that end, he recently wrote a paper with his Harvard colleague Edward Glaeser, a leading scholar of urban and regional economics, and Benjamin Austin that examined how the rising rate of nonemployment among prime-aged men in parts of the American heartland had fed into social dysfunctions."

Stringer, who said in a statement that his office would investigate \u201cthe city\u2019s procedures for addressing lead poisoning hazards to protect the health of all children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is horrifying that the department of health kept this information under wraps and it is outrageous that the city continues to justify and minimize this scandal,\u201d Mr. Stringer said.\n\nIn response, Ms. Lapeyrolerie said that the health department always abided by federal guidelines.\n\nLead can cause devastating harm in children, stunting their intellectual growth and affecting cardiovascular, hormone and immune systems.\n\nA health department official said the city has recently changed its policy and has begun inspecting all Nycha apartments where children under 18 years old have been found with a lead level of 5 micrograms per deciliter or more. And, on Sunday, the city said it would expand that policy citywide by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe expect to reach thousands of children this way,\u201d said Corinne Schiff, the deputy commissioner of environmental health at the health department.\n\nThe data released by city officials also showed that the number of children under age 6 in public housing with elevated blood levels has steadily decreased from 229 in 2012 to 114 in 2016. Health officials said the five-year figure of 820 represents primarily individual children rather than the same children being tested year after year. Close to one-third of the 400,000 residents living in public housing are children.\n\nCitywide, childhood lead poisoning has decreased by 87 percent from 37,344 cases in 2005 to 4,928 in 2016."

When recently searching for fares from Oregon to Athens, I found most round-trip fares were about $2,000 each \u2014 a pricey proposition since I\u2019m buying four tickets. But then I noticed a one-way fare under $400 to London on WestJet, a Calgary-based, low-cost carrier. A few more clicks and I realized that I could spend the weekend in London and then proceed to Corfu on Ryanair for $125.\n\nI didn\u2019t see any cheap flights home from Corfu, but I found that Norwegian Air had a $90 flight from there to Copenhagen. Norwegian makes it easy to find their lowest fares, displaying them by month on their route map and fare calendars. Ryanair also has a useful route map with pricing.\n\nCopenhagen wasn\u2019t part of my original plan, but it\u2019s a splendid place to spend a few days, and Norwegian often has ridiculously low, one-way, trans-Atlantic fares from $200 and up. (T he airline\u2019s attractively priced premium class recently started at just $599 one way from London\u2019s Gatwick Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.)\n\nAfter booking my trip to London, I learned that WestJet\u2019s pilots had voted to strike days before I made my plans. I contacted the airline and a spokeswoman said that WestJet would refund passengers if flights are canceled because of union action.\n\nAt first I was concerned, knowing that if there was a strike, a refund wouldn\u2019t help us get to Europe, at least not at the rock-bottom price I had found. But the more I thought about it, I realized that labor issues present both risks and opportunities for low fares. Strikes are often averted at the last minute or last only a few days. If your timing is flexible, it could be worth a gamble.\n\nIn this case, my concerns \u2014 including the possibility of an actual strike \u2014 were alleviated quickly as WestJet pilots agreed to a mediation process with the airline that is likely to resolve the impasse (which was still ongoing at the time this story was reported, and involves wages and working conditions, among other issues).\n\nBrian Kelly, the founder of the website The Points Guy, which helps travelers maximize their frequent flier miles and find deals, says that in assessing the risk of airline labor problems, he\u2019s more concerned when he hears of potential strikes in Europe, as they tend to drag on longer there than in North America."

			"text": "Reader, here\u2019s an incomplete list of things you shouldn\u2019t try with elephants: a memory contest, jump rope and castration.\n\nSee, in addition to having uncanny recall and a firm relationship with gravity, elephants have their testicles nestled deep within their bodies, all the way up near their kidneys. That\u2019s unusual: In most other mammals, testicles form during embryonic development near the kidneys and then descend, either to the lower abdomen or an external scrotum, by the time of a male\u2019s birth.\n\nBiologists have wondered about this discrepancy for decades. Did the earliest mammals retain their testicles, like elephants, or did they let their family jewels drop? A new study, published Thursday in PLOS Biology, says it was the latter.\n\nStudying the DNA of 71 mammals, a German team concluded that testicular descent is an ancestral trait that was later lost in so-called afrotherians, a ragtag group that includes elephants, manatees and several insect-eaters that live in or originated from Africa."

But how fast is brisk?\n\nA helpful new study of walking speed and health concludes that the answer seems to be about 100 steps per minute, a number that is probably lower than many of us might expect.\n\nCurrent exercise guidelines almost always state that we should walk at a brisk pace rather than stroll leisurely. But the recommendations do not always define what brisk walking means and, when they do, can deploy daunting terminology or technicalities.\n\nThey may say, for instance, that brisk walking requires three metabolic equivalents of task, or METs, meaning that it uses about three times as much energy as sitting still.\n\nOr they might tell us that brisk walking occurs at a pace that increases our heart rate until it reaches about 70 percent of our heart rate maximum, a measurement that few of us fully understand or have the heart rate monitor and mathematical acuity needed to track and parse those percentages."

Even in our age of global fashion, global communication, global everything, he maintains the earthy terroir of his motherland. For his new men\u2019s collection, he bypassed Paris Fashion Week, where he shows his women\u2019s wear, and headed down to Marseille, on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nMr. Porte Jacquemus is a Proven\u00e7al, from Mallemort, an hour outside of Marseille \u2014 \u201ca nowhere town,\u201d he said, \u201creally nowhere.\u201d But when he began designing for men, he loved the ideal of a Mediterranean man, and where better to place one?

One-third of an ellipsis would be a single DOT.\n\nToday\u2019s Theme\n\nInspired by a line from the film \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d Mr. White has taken the advice given to Mark Zuckerberg to heart: In one scene, Mr. Zuckerberg wants to call his new website \u201cThe Facebook,\u201d whereupon an adviser tells him to DROP THE \u2018THE.\u2019\n\nMr. White takes four familiar base phrases that all contain the word \u201cthe,\u201d DROPs THE \u2018THE,\u2019 and clues them in that new and punny way. I liked these, although at least one may depend not only on getting the theme, but one\u2019s background or age as well. For example, at 17A, the clue \u201cEarly \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 camera command?\u201d takes the THE out of CUT TO THE CHASE to get CUT TO CHASE. That\u2019s very funny, as long as you know that the actor Chevy Chase was one of the breakout stars of the first season of SNL in 1975. At 24A, it helps to know that POP means soda (this was something I first learned when I went away to college in a different area than where I grew up), which is why the entry POP QUESTION refers to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nI could have sworn that Sean Parker, in the film \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d advised Mark Zuckerberg to LOSE THE THE, and so it was with my original submission. But the editors (who accepted the puzzle conditionally) and checking crew knew better, advised me as such, and in pretty quick time I lost the LOSE and dropped in the DROP \u2014 which in fact improved the fill. Good thing they\u2019re both 4 letters long. I\u2019m a fan of Chevy Chase and Kevin Bacon, and also a part-time physics nut, so three of the four theme entries felt in my wheelhouse. \u201cWhat\u2019s matter?\u201d is an enormous question, and still eludes me. And the revealer? Jesse Eisenberg (who played Zuckerberg) is flat-out brilliant as an actor, author, and humorist for The New Yorker, so it was with pleasure I could obliquely tip my hat his way.\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nAlmost finished solving but need a bit more help? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nWarning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.\n\nYour thoughts?"

			"text": "DER: My word list originally started as a few English dictionaries combined with words that had previously appeared in crossword puzzles. Since then, I\u2019ve probably added many thousands of words by hand. I try to pay attention to interesting words and phrases that come up in everyday life and I\u2019ll add those to a list on my phone using the Notes app. I\u2019ll check that list first when I\u2019m filling a grid, whether that\u2019s a themed puzzle or a themeless.\n\nPASCO: I have a basic word list, which I haven\u2019t maintained a lot. The only real changes I make are when I add new, fresh words that I want to include in a crossword. I can go into the program and manually give those words high scores in my list, so they get priority when I\u2019m filling grids. I also fill manually \u2014 I use Crossfire, but I don\u2019t use the Autofill feature. It takes longer, but guiding the whole fill process by hand makes me feel more in touch with the crossword. It really helps me get a sense of what letter patterns work in a grid and which ones don\u2019t.\n\nDER: If you rely on Autofill, that guarantees you won\u2019t have the opportunity to introduce something new that isn\u2019t in your word list, so we discourage it. I prefer a semi-supervised approach \u2014 using software to verify the fill you have so far still works, and suggesting words that you might want to put into the grid next, while you select words by hand. During that process, I often think of words that would also work, but weren\u2019t in my list.\n\nPASCO: One good resource for finding words outside your word list is Onelook.com. If you have an answer like ??RK??A?, you can look it up on the site and get a list of words that match that pattern. This has bailed me out so many times when filling a grid \u2014 sometimes, all it takes is one entry you hadn\u2019t thought of to hold together an entire section.\n\nQuality Is Never an Accident\n\nPASCO: In terms of the words themselves, my fill philosophy is \u201cclean fill above everything else.\u201d Filling by hand guarantees that every part of the grid gets my attention, so junk words are less likely to slip in.\n\nDER: I\u2019ll second that. How you fill the grid doesn\u2019t matter as much as ensuring that every word in your grid is high quality. Ideally, it should seem like you purposely chose every word to be in your crossword. This is especially true for themeless puzzles, where you begin with no constraints. Most constructors try to inject fresh words and phrases, often from current events or pop culture, that have never appeared before in a crossword. Other than that, we strive for liveliness, which is ultimately a judgment that can vary among constructors and editors. Conversational phrases like \u201cWAIT, WHAT?\u201d or \u201cDON\u2019T ASK\u201d are always fun to include in a crossword. It\u2019s hard to describe objectively, but most constructors would agree that ESCAPE ROOM and SUBTWEET (which Paolo debuted) are more lively than, say, the unremarkable ESSENCES or, ALAN-A-DALE, which is dreaded for its overuse.\n\nPASCO: Thanks for the shout out, Kevin! By \u201cdebuted,\u201d we mean that it appeared in The New York Times Crossword for the first time. Constructors like debuting words, since it usually means that they\u2019re fresh or new."

Other scientists confirmed that dopamine is depleted in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative condition that causes tremors and rigidity, and L-dopa soon became the standard treatment for the illness.\n\nDr. Carlsson shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with two American researchers, Dr. Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard, who made their own discoveries about the transmission of chemical signals in the brain. In awarding the Nobel, the Karolinska Institute of Sweden said the contributions of the three scientists were \u201ccrucial for an understanding of the normal function of the brain\u201d and for how signal disturbances could \u201cgive rise to neurological and psychiatric disorders.\u201d\n\nArvid Carlsson was born on Jan. 25, 1923, in Uppsala, Sweden, one of four siblings in \u201can academic middle-class family,\u201d he wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the Nobel committee. He grew up in the Swedish city of Lund, where his family moved after his father joined the University of Lund faculty as a history professor.\n\n\u201cMy mother had passed a master-of-arts examination and my father a Ph.D. degree at the University of Uppsala,\u201d Dr. Carlsson wrote. \u201cMy mother had a keen interest in research throughout her life but gave priority to raising her children and to assisting her husband in his research. However, when her husband died at the age of 76 she, then 71 years old, started to devote herself entirely to her favorite area of research, that is the legal status of women in the Middle Ages in Sweden. She published a couple of books and a number of articles on this subject in Swedish, which rendered her an honorary Ph.D. degree at the University of Uppsala several years later.\u201d\n\nHis family had a \u201cstrong orientation toward the humanities,\u201d Dr. Carlsson wrote. His older brother and sister followed his father into the humanities, but Dr. Carlsson, in an act of youthful rebellion, chose to study medicine, a field he saw as more useful than the arts."

Kennedy announced his retirement, speculation swirled that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, would be overturned. Most legal experts say that day is years away, if it arrives at all. A more likely scenario, they predict, is that a rightward-shifting court would uphold efforts to restrict abortion, which would encourage some states to further limit access.\n\nEven then, a full-fledged return to an era of back-alley, coat-hanger abortions seems improbable. In the decades since Roe was decided, a burst of scientific innovation has produced more effective, simpler and safer ways to prevent pregnancies and to stop them after conception \u2014 advances that have contributed to an abortion rate that has already plunged by half since the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a new world now,\u201d said Aziza Ahmed, a law professor at Northeastern University who writes about reproductive rights law. \u201cThe majority of American women are on some form of contraception.

Bolton, the national security adviser and historically a deep skeptic that North Korea will ever fully disarm, came as Mr. Pompeo prepares to make his third trip to North Korea late this week.\n\nMr. Pompeo will arrive in Pyongyang with a proposed schedule for disarmament that would begin with a declaration by North Korea of all its weapons, production facilities and missiles. The declaration will be the first real test of the North\u2019s candor, amid increasing concern that it may be trying to conceal parts of its nuclear program.

Over the course of the project, we conducted multiple interviews with more than 100 poor and working-class mothers of young children, including Maylee\u2019s mother, Ashley Taylor. We also made ethnographic observations of 12 families: accompanying them on trips to grocery stores and food pantries, tagging along during school lunches and doctor\u2019s visits, and spending time in their homes as they cooked and ate.

But even with all her efforts, there just wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t eat the way that I\u2019d like,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nIn 2016, children in 3.1 million households experienced food insecurity at some point during the year. Whether temporary or chronic, food insecurity is devastating for kids. As a nation, we have historically tried to align our policies with the belief that we should do what we can to prevent children from being hungry. When he signed the National School Lunch Act in 1946, President Truman said, \u201cIn the long view, no nation is any healthier than its children.\u201d Almost 20 years later, President Johnson argued that the food stamp program represented a way of \u201capply[ing] the power of America\u2019s new abundance to the task of building a better life for every American.\u201d"

There are questions that seem unsolvable until you consider outlandish possibilities: Does this answer read backward? Do multiple letters reside in a single box? It was during these moments that our real bonding took place. We challenged strongly held perceptions, released ideas that felt accurate but did not represent the only truth. Using a combination of logic and flexibility, together we arrived at places that once seemed impossible.\n\nI much preferred puzzling to watching my son pack up his countless possessions: camping equipment, snowboard gear, carabiners and ropes. Calculus books in one pile, Calvin and Hobbes in another. It all reminded me of that teary car ride years ago, after first dropping him at college. I didn\u2019t cry because I missed him \u2014 he hadn\u2019t been gone long enough for that \u2014 but because I thought I\u2019d done such a flawed job raising him. Like me, he ate much too fast and could barely fold a T-shirt. I remember thinking, \u201cIf I just had more time.\u201d As if time could solve what I truly was stuck on.\n\nOur first children teach us to parent; they teach us the lessons we need to learn in order to let go. A few years ago, Noah reminded me what a poor student I\u2019d been. A trivial argument about cellphone data escalated quickly into one of our biggest fights. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for what\u2019s wrong with everything,\u201d he finally shrieked, eyes unforgiving. His words hung sharply between us, revealing a clue I\u2019d been missing for years.\n\nWhat he was saying was true, and it wasn\u2019t about gigabytes. As a mother, I\u2019d learned to relax about many things, but maybe not the right things. I\u2019d complain that roller coasters were too fast and body surfing was too wet. Even sashimi felt a little too wild for me. He was telling me I had failed him by not stepping fearlessly into his world. Or maybe more to the point: by not stepping fearlessly aside.\n\nNoah and I crushed a few puzzles that week and then said goodbye. He drove off on a Monday and I expected each day to feel harder, in the same way the puzzle gets tougher over the week. But having Noah gone was easier than I thought it would be, a house filled with less smelly laundry, fewer cluttering shoes, more food in the fridge, and an unquantifiable amount of calm."

My stretch of sand, on the island of Nantucket, in the tiny village of Siasconset, next to an even tinier cluster of old cod fishing shacks, has some unattractive features. There is a consistent streak of crimson seaweed that inhabits the water closest to the shoreline and that one must swim past (with mouth closed) to reach clear water; a famously fast-moving riptide that will deposit you far from your towel after a short dip; and a plethora of black seals (read: shark bait) that pop their dog-like heads up through the waves. For these reasons, it has never been very popular with tourists \u2014 or with natives \u2014 but I live by its rhythms.\n\nIn the mornings, when the sun hasn\u2019t yet burned through the fog and the sand is still cool from dew, walking the musty-smelling beach has a calming effect that is unparalleled.

At sunset, while our neighbors surf-cast for the bluefish that jump from the water into view, I\u2019ll drag a beach chair, some hors d\u2019oeuvres and a cold beer to watch.

Those letters spell words that can be preceded by the word SECRET, and we get a big hint in the revealer at 59A: IT\u2019S A SECRET, clued as \u201c\u2018Keep this between us\u2019 \u2026 or hint to this puzzle's circled letters.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t see it? Let\u2019s look at 16A: \u201cItalian food item that can be stuffed and baked\u201d is PASTA SHELL, which contains the word STASH in the circled letters. Put the word SECRET in front of it, and you get SECRET STASH, like the good chocolate that I keep in the back of the freezer so my kids won\u2019t eat it.\n\nSimilarly, at 49A, we have PRIME NUMBER, which contains the SECRET MENU that I never seem to be successful at ordering from. What, you didn\u2019t know that some restaurants have secret menus?\n\nConstructor\u2019s Notes\n\nAs with many constructors, this marks the fulfillment of a long time dream. I\u2019ve always loved playing with words, and back in middle school I would eagerly await Will Shortz\u2019s next Sunday Puzzle challenge, tuning in to NPR at exactly 10:41 a.m. (But who\u2019s counting?). In college, I was inspired by the work of Dustin Foley, who wrote a daily puzzle comic strip. Back then I was filling 15x15 grids printed from Microsoft Word, and the results weren\u2019t particularly encouraging. (To wit: Once I tried asking a crush out via crossword on Valentine\u2019s Day. It went unsolved.) Puzzling at Brown really took off soon after I graduated, and I vowed that one day I would join the ranks of Shortz-certified Brunonian cruciverbalists. [Insert training montage here.] I\u2019m a huge road trip enthusiast, and over time I\u2019ve come to realize the importance of certain life skills \u2026 like navigating the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger. (Psst \u2026 think Will would allow \u201cAnimal Style\u201d in a grid?) I first considered a SECRET MENU puzzle in 2014, lamenting that the only decent phrase I could find a secret \u201cmenu\u201d in was PRIME NUMBER. Years later, \u201cIT\u2019S A SECRET\u201d struck me as a good revealer, leading to this puzzle. The veritable cornucopia of potential thematic material led to high ambitions and an inevitable Grid Reckoning. It eventually led me to attempt a theme answer stack \u00e0 la Patrick Berry, though the challenge left this mere mortal with the unfortunate TELNET and cheater squares at 6- and 65-Across. Considering that every down answer intersects between one and three theme entries, I was pleased to keep the damage fairly contained. (I know, ID EST can be a bit of a party pooper \u2026 though initially he\u2019s great.) Hopefully MARKUP LANGUAGE \u2014 the \u2018ML\u2019 of \u2018HTML\u2019 \u2014 isn\u2019t too outr\u00e9 for a Monday puzzle. My favorite find was WHAT A GENTLEMAN, a comment I\u2019ve heard in the wild! SHOPPER, \u00e0 la GRASSHOPPER, was the coolest possibility I didn\u2019t incorporate. Hope you enjoyed the puzzle! I\u2019d like to thank Jeff Chen, who has a) put up with me for years as I\u2019ve learned the ropes and peppered him with random crossword ideas; and b) made great resources available for budding constructors everywhere.\n\n\n\n\u2018The Riddler: Fantastic Puzzles From FiveThirtyEight\u2019\n\nIf you are a fan of Martin Gardner\u2019s puzzles, you will enjoy the new collection of brain janglers that run on FiveThirtyEight in Oliver Roeder\u2019s The Riddler series.\n\nThe book will be released on Oct. 9, and you can pre-order a copy of these math and logic challenges on Amazon.com."

Maybe, I thought, this was a universal longing \u2014 to be listened to, rather than apologized at.\n\nShe was generous, saying it meant a lot to her that I had come. I was expecting anger, but what she felt, she said, was a deep sadness. She, too, had known that our relationship, in those 14 years, had long been too smothering. But she was sad, almost unthinkably sad, that I left her in the way that I did.\n\nCausing someone sadness is different from causing pain or fear. It\u2019s duller, deeper, and it lasts longer. I sat with those words and felt tremendous remorse. I remembered a photo I had seen of her sitting by a window, some months after I had left her. She was still mostly bald from the chemo, and she stared hard into the camera, her mouth tugged back into a kind of grimace, as if she were swallowing the world.

I had grown up with a very sick mother; she gave me the chance to feel loved and protected. But when that love was threatened by her illness, I could only think of rescue, much as I had when I was a child. My therapist offered that to me, and was the one person who, seemingly, would never get sick on me, never die.

In December, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters that the president congratulated Mr. Murdoch on the impending Disney deal. In addition, Mr. Trump praises Fox News and its hosts every chance he gets \u2014 and they regularly return the favor. While Disney will not acquire Fox News or the Fox network and stations as part of this deal, the acquisition will make the Murdoch family the largest individual shareholders in Disney, increasing their wealth by billions of dollars.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, will surely argue that the president\u2019s feelings about CNN and Fox News have no bearing on his decisions. But it is mystifying why Mr. Delrahim took such a hard line against AT&T-Time Warner, which legal experts argued would be a difficult case to bring because of the nature of the merger, while going so easy on Disney-Fox.\n\nBy acquiring Time Warner, AT&T was seeking to buy a supplier \u2014 a classic vertical integration move that is hard to challenge because it involves businesses in different parts of an industry. In recent decades, judges have typically concluded that such combinations generate efficiency gains that more than offset any harm they might cause to consumers. That\u2019s why regulators have tended to approve these deals as long as the merging companies agree not to take unfair advantage of their market power.\n\nBy comparison, antitrust regulators and judges are usually much more dubious of horizontal deals like Disney-Fox. In these cases, it\u2019s much easier to show that the combined company would have the power to raise prices and limit choices. In the movie business, for example, Disney already wields considerable clout \u2014 its studios accounted for more than a third of box office sales in the first five months of the year. The additional 15 percent share of box office sales that the company will gain through this deal no doubt will increase Disney\u2019s clout when it negotiates with movie-theater chains. For instance, the company might be able to demand top billing for its movies and a bigger share of revenue than smaller studios get. According to a handful of theater owners who talked to The Wall Street Journal last year, Disney has already engaged in such tactics, forcing them to accept more onerous terms if they wanted to show its blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi.\u201d"

Taken by Louis Draper, who had a keen sense of light and shadow, the photograph shows an older black woman standing on a busy Harlem street corner. In the crowd, her face is finely in focus. She is tired, gazing off into the distance, as she waits, with serious dignity and grace.\n\nIt was an everyday scene that in its own way was extraordinary. Led by the astute chronicler of Harlem life, Roy DeCarava, the show aimed to reclaim the beauty of the African-American woman. Kamoinge\u2019s group exhibition was among the first to carefully and radically picture the black woman\u2019s elegance and pride."

			"text": "With four minutes left in the added periods, Croatia had a tantalizing opportunity to win it outright. Croatia\u2019s Luka Modric passed from the halfway line to a streaking Ante Rebic. He beat the Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, and raced toward the goal unimpeded. Jorgensen, the Danish defender rushing in from behind, had little choice but to bring down Rebic, and it was an easy penalty call for the referee.\n\nBut Modric\u2019s penalty kick was not strong, and Schmeichel came up with a huge save, holding onto the ball to prevent a rebound.\n\nAnd so the two teams went on to the second penalty shootout of the day,which turned into a display of solid goalkeeping guesswork. Each side had two of its first four shots blocked, which actually gave Schmeichel three penalty saves, counting his previous one on Modric.\n\nThen came the fifth round of the shootout. Nicolai Jorgensen\u2019s bid to score for Denmark was saved by Croatian keeper Danijel Subasic \u2014 his third save in the shootout. It was up to Schmeichel to yet again come through for Denmark and keep the shootout going. But Ivan Rakitic, the Barcelona star, fired the ball past him, and Croatia was through to the next round.\n\nCroatia must be excited about a matchup with host Russia in the quarterfinal next Saturday. But on the evidence of this game, Russia may be excited about the matchup, too. And in any case, both teams can thank their goalies for stellar work in the shootouts. They kept both Russian and Croatia alive.\n\nHere\u2019s how Croatia advanced past Denmark:\n\nPK: Croatia 3, Denmark 2\n\nCroatia wins the shootout 3-2! Rakitic goes left, Schmeichel goes wrong. Croatia advances!\n\nPK: Denmark 2, Croatia 2\n\nSAVED! Jorgensen stutter-steps, shoots, and Subasic dives and pulls off another save! Croatia can win it here!\n\nPK: Denmark 2, Croatia 2\n\nSAVED Pivaric smashes it left, and Schmeichel jumps to save! Great keeping from both sides. Last kicks coming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPK: Denmark 2, Croatia 2\n\nSAVED Schone places it OK, but Subasic is right there!\n\nPK: Denmark 2, Croatia 2\n\nGOAL! Modric. He blew the earlier penalty, and Schmeichel guesses right. But the ball scoots over him.\n\nPK: Denmark 2, Croatia 1\n\nGOAL Krohn-Delhi. Subasic guesses wrong.\n\nPK: Denmark 1, Croatia 1\n\nGOAL. Kramaric.\n\nPK: Denmark 1, Croatia 0\n\nGOAL Kjaer gets it right with a penalty blasted right.\n\nPK: Croatia 0, Denmark 0\n\nSAVE Schmeichel also guesses right and saves Badelj\u2019s effort!\n\nPK: Denmark 0, Croatia 0\n\nSAVE Eriksen of course takes the first kick for Denmark. Subasic guesses right, dives and saves it!\n\nPK: Denmark Goes First\n\nDenmark wins the toss and will kick first. That\u2019s a big advantage historically. Subasic of Croatia and Schmeichel of Denmark the keepers.\n\nPenalty Kicks: One of These Should Go In...\n\nHere comes the lottery of penalties. We\u2019ll give you all the action, kick by kick.\n\n120\u2019: Last Chances Before Penalty Kicks\n\nMore from Croatia in the dying minutes. Kramaric hoists one way too high.\n\nPhoto\n\n118\u2019: So Close...\n\nWow, Luka Modric had the chance to send Croatia to the quarterfinals. And he blew it. Not a good shot. Modric set up the play that won the penalty. Points to him for that. But that penalty kick. Ouch.\n\n116\u2019: SAVE Schmeichel!\n\nModric ...saved by Schmeichel! It was not that well hit and Schmeichel dived on it.\n\n114\u2019: PENALTY to CROATIA!\n\nA late twist! Modric passed from the halfway line to a streaking Rebic. He beat the keeper, and Denmark\u2019s Jorgensen brought him down. Clear as day.\n\n113\u2019: Knudsen Still Taking Sweet Old Time\n\nKnudsen continues to set up for and take throw-ins with the deliberation of a chess champion.\n\n112\u2019: Penalty Kicks Seem Likely\n\nThe managers must be thinking about their penalty kick orders at this point.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n109\u2019: Badelj in for Croatia\n\nCroatia brings Milan Badelj in for striker Mandzukic. That\u2019s their fourth sub as well.\n\n108\u2019: Sisto!\n\nSisto jukes three players and shoots! The angle is too tight though. Wide.\n\n106\u2019: More Subs, Including Sisto!\n\nHere comes substitute No. 4 for Denmark. 4? Yep, it\u2019s a new rule when there\u2019s extra time. And clearly someone has been reading this report, because Denmark is sending in Pione Sisto! Let\u2019s see if he can liven things up. Braithwaite goes out.\n\nHalftime in Extra Time\n\nI\u2019m not seeing a goal in the last 15, are you?\n\nKasper Schmeichel gives his team a vigorous pep talk. Is he urging them to score, or just to hold tight on defense?\n\n105\u2019: Corners to Nowhere\n\nModric gets a couple of corners in a row for Croatia. Nothing doing.\n\n103\u2019: Who Wants It More?\n\nOne of these teams will have the chance to play Russia for a World Cup semifinal berth! But someone\u2019s got to put the ball in the net.\n\n100\u2019: Denmark Getting Closer\n\nSchone of Denmark from just outside the box. It\u2019s wide \u2014 but not as wide as most of the other shots have been! A step forward.\n\n99\u2019: Krohn-Dehli in for Denmark\n\nKrohn-Dehli will come in as Denmark\u2019s third sub, for Delaney\n\n97\u2019: Missed Chances for Denmark\n\nFirst Eriksen tries to get it in to Jorgensen, then Braithwaite tries. They can\u2019t get it there.\n\nEriksen hasn\u2019t done much with corners, so he tosses it to Knudsen to try. His ball drops into the box and for a second things look chancy, but it\u2019s cleared. Still all Denmark.\n\n94: Slow Start to Extra Time\n\nDenmark with the best of the first few minutes, but no real chances.\n\n90\u2019: Extra Time Kicks Off\n\nFirst period, extra time kicks off.\n\nExtra Time: Can the Next 30 Minutes Be More Like the First Four?\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have extra time. Surely the 30 minutes to come will more closely resemble the madcap first five minutes of the game than the sometimes sloppy next 85. Right? Right?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n93\u2019: Back to Denmark\n\nEriksen takes a shot and earns a last-ditch corner. Punched away ... to Braithwaite, who fires wide.\n\n92\u2019: Croatia Chance\n\nRakitic from outside the box \u2014 it\u2019s got the speed, but as usual not the accuracy. Wide.\n\n91\u2019: Denmark in No Hurry\n\nKnudsen takes a lot of time to trot to the sidelines for a throw-in, drawing some whistles from the crowd.\n\n89\u2019: Looking Like Extra Time\n\nIt\u2019s hot, and the players seem tired. So what is called for here? How about 30 more minutes of football?\n\n88\u2019: Late Chance for Denmark\n\nSchone gets some time over a ball for Denmark but can\u2019t put it on target.\n\n85\u2019: Croatia Chance\n\nPretty good header by Perisic of Croatia is a little too high and a little too wide.\n\nKovacic is back, by the way.\n\n84\u2019: Croatia\u2019s Kovacic Limps Off\n\nKovacic is swarmed by three Denmark defenders and goes down. He requires treatment and limps off.\n\n81\u2019: Missed Connections\n\nThe BBC reports that 1 out of 22 crosses in this game has reached a teammate. Yikes.\n\n77\u2019: Croatia Now Attacking\n\nModric arrives to a Croatia attack late and promptly one-times a shot from distance. Off target.\n\nThen another long-distance shot, this time from Rebic of Croatia. Easy save for Schmeichel.\n\n76\u2019: That Other Jorgensen\n\nJust to clarify: the Danish Jorgensen that checked in earlier was Nicolai Jorgensen, the striker, not Mathias Jorgensen, the defender.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n75\u2019: More Pressure From Denmark\n\nA Denmark 3-on-4 turns into a 4-on-5, and Eriksen shoots in the end. Wide.\n\n73\u2019: Denmark Chance!\n\nPoulsen is the creator down the wing, and new man Jorgensen takes the shot. Right to the keeper, but still encouraging for Denmark.\n\n72\u2019: Kovacic in for Croatia\n\nKovacic in for Brozovic, a midfield swap for Croatia.\n\n71\u2019: Not Many Quality Chances for Denmark\n\nBetter from Denmark lately in terms of ball control, but it hasn\u2019t been able to get the ball in there for a serious chance.\n\n66\u2019: Croatia Back on the Attack\n\nModric on the corner for Croatia. Right across the face of goal, but a Dane head gets there first. When Croatia regroups and launches another cross, Schmeichel punches it away a mile.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Croatian defenders, and even midfielders like Modric, have been getting back swiftly.\n\n59\u2019: Where\u2019s Sisto?\n\nDenmark brought in Schone for Christensen at halftime. But I think I\u2019d like to see Pione Sisto for Denmark, a great passer who might be able to get something going.\n\n57\u2019: Denmark Chance!\n\nPoulsen beats Brozovic down the side and crosses. It hits a defender and then sits unmoving in front of goal for several tantalizing seconds. Croatia gets to it first, foiling Braithwaite of Denmark.\n\n54\u2019: Eriksen Looking for His Chance\n\nAn Eriksen set-up pass is way off. Aside from stepping up to free kicks and such, Eriksen has been quiet for Denmark, and Poulsen, the team\u2019s other scorer, even more so.\n\n49\u2019: Denmark, So Defensive\n\nDenmark committed 8 fouls in the first half to Croatia\u2019s 2. That reversal of expectations was prompted mostly because Denmark sat back and defended much more than Croatia, which was the more incisive attacker.\n\n45\u2019: Second Half Begins\n\nThese teams both scored in the blink of an eye to start the game. Now they have 45 minutes to find one more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHalftime\n\nA madcap start gave way to 41 more prosaic minutes, and the score is tied, 1-1. Croatia got the best of the half, statistically: 9 shots to 5 for Denmark, and 56-44 percent in possession.\n\nPhoto\n\n45\u2019: Another Save for Schmeichel\n\nRakitic has too much space and can measure his shot, but Denmark keeper Schmeichel, who is getting a workout, is in the right position for the save.\n\n43\u2019: Chance for Eriksen\n\nEriksen gets the ball with a little space but three Croatians close him down. He gets the ball a moment later and tries a little lob. It\u2019s wide.\n\n39\u2019: Chance for Croatia\n\nModric sends in a beautiful free kick and Lovren gets a head to it for Croatia but it goes wide. Good chance.\n\n34\u2019: Croatia Keeping Pressure On\n\nSchmeichel dives on a ball before Strinic can get to it.\n\n30\u2019: Chances for Croatia\n\nRakitic shoots, Schmeichel punches it away. Brozovic shoots, Schmeichel punches it away. Rebound to Perisic with the goal at his mercy. He mis-hits it, then launches one over the net.\n\n28\u2019: Another Chance for Denmark\n\nA good spell of possession for Denmark leads to a sliding shot by Braithwaite and a leg save by Subasic.\n\n23\u2019: Denmark Chance\n\nEriksen of Denmark makes noise for the first time with a run followed by a mid-range shot. It\u2019s wide.\n\n21\u2019: Penalty?!\n\nManduzic believes that Knudsen of Denmark pulled him down in the box. There was an arm over the shoulder, but was it a penalty? The ref says no. The ref is Mr. Pitana of Argentina.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n20\u2019: Things Slowing Down\n\nThe incident-per-minute rate of this game, after threatening to break records in the first four minutes, is slipping down to more normal levels now.\n\n18\u2019: Croatia Attacking\n\nMore probing attacks from Croatia. Denmark is playing a more defensive style.\n\n13\u2019: Corner to Croatia\n\nA corner to Croatia follows. Modric takes, and that\u2019s cleared too.\n\n11\u2019: Croatia Settling In\n\nBoth teams a bit stunned by the rapid fire goals, but Croatia is starting to take command of the ball. Here\u2019s a free kick from just outside the box .... Headed clear.\n\n4\u2019: GOAL CROATIA!!! Tied 1-1\n\nMadness in Nizhny Novgorod! Dalsgaard had a simple clearance, but he spanked it right into the head of his teammate Christensen. It caromed back to Croatia, and Mandzukic accepted the gift and scored. It\u2019s 1-1. What next?\n\nPhoto\n\n2\u2019: GOAL Denmark!\n\nWhat happened? A bit of head tennis at midfield led to a throw-in for Denmark. Knudsen made a huge one, landing it in the box, where Croatia was in disarray. Delaney got a touch, inched it to Jorgensen, and he shot; it bounced off a couple of Croatian players, including the keeper, and went in! Bizarre, but it counts!\n\n0\u2019: Kickoff!\n\nDenmark in white, Croatia in black. We got a hot one in Nizhny Novgorod tonight. It\u2019s over 80 even this deep into the Russian evening.\n\nCroatia Rested and Ready\n\nCroatia had already qualified for this round when it played its third group game against Iceland, so it rested more than half its starters. They\u2019re all back today, which should be frightening even for Denmark\u2019s tight defense.\n\nCroatia Not as Lovable as Other Teams\n\nCroatia does not fit the \u201clovable underdog\u201d tag of teams like Iceland, in part because it plays a little dirty. Croatia has eight yellow cards, the most of any team left in the tournament. It has 55 fouls: That ranks second, but only just behind France, which has played one more game.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Underdog to Contender\n\nNobody\u2019s talking about Croatia as a plucky underdog anymore; it is now considered a serious contender to win the World Cup. Aside from Uruguay\u2019s two early wins, no small country has ever lifted the trophy. But Croatia looks like the real deal so far, with a crack defense, organization and several attacking weapons. Right now it is the fourth favorite at 6-1 to win the Cup, after Brazil, France and England, And its odds will shorten with a win today.\n\nSpain\u2019s Elimination May Clear Path for Winner\n\nThe result of today\u2019s first game makes this game all the more important. Instead of facing mighty Spain, the winner will get Russia, a team that has ridden home field advantage and more than a few lucky breaks. Surely the winner here will fancy a trip to the semifinals: It would be Denmark\u2019s first ever and Croatia\u2019s second, after 1998.\n\nTwo Good Defenses, One Good Offense\n\nDenmark and Croatia both have strong defenses; they have so far surrendered only one goal each. But Croatia\u2019s offense is much more prolific, with seven goals to two for Denmark. Croatia has taken 39 shots; Denmark has taken 25, ahead only of Panama and Iran.\n\nDenmark\u2019s Starting Lineup\n\nGoalkeeper: 1 Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester)\n\nDefenders: 4 Simon Kjaer (Sevilla); 13 Mathias Jorgensen (Huddersfield); 6 Andreas Christensen (Chelsea); 14 Henrik Dalsgaard (Brentford); 5 Jonas Knudsen (Ipswich)\n\nMidfielders: 10 Christian Eriksen (Tottenham); 8 Thomas Delaney (Werder Bremen)\n\nForwards: 21 Andreas Cornelius (Atalanta); 11 Martin Braithwaite (Middlesbrough); 20 Yussuf Poulsen (RB Leipzig)\n\nWith 14 saves, Schmeichel ranks second at the Cup behind Guillermo Ochoa of Mexico.\n\nCroatia\u2019s Starting Lineup\n\nGoalkeeper: 23 Danijel Subasic (Monaco)\n\nDefenders: 21 Domagoj Vida (Besiktas); 3 Ivan Strinic (Milan); 6 Dejan Lovren (Liverpool); 2 Sime Vrsaljko (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid)\n\nMidfielders: 10 Luka Modric (Real Madrid); 7 Ivan Rakitic (Barcelona); 11 Marcelo Brozovic (Inter Milan)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForwards: 17 Mario Mandzukic; (Juventus); 4 Ivan Perisic (Inter Milan); 18 Ante Rebic (Fiorentina)\n\nCroatia Will Lean on Modric\n\nCroatia\u2019s top scorer with two goals is its 5-foot-6-inch star, Luka Modric. At 32, he is at the peak of a career that has taken him to stardom at Spurs and Real Madrid. He is also Croatia\u2019s top passer, and the team rises and falls on his performance.\n\nDenmark vs. Croatia Top Story Lines\n\n\u2022 Croatia has advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup for the second time in its history. The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark\u2019s first visit to the last 16 since 2002.\n\n\u2022 Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland.\n\n\u2022 With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game.\n\n\u2022 One of Denmark\u2019s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, \u201cWhat I can say about Eriksen is, he\u2019s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He\u2019s the most important player for Denmark.\u201d The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension.\n\n\u2022 These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Denmark won that game, with Peter Schmeichel, father of current keeper Kasper Schmeichel, in goal.\n\n\u2022 Croatia is a comfortable favorite to win, with Denmark 4-1 or so.\n\nSome Pregame Reading\n\n\u2022 What happened? Both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were eliminated on Saturday."

A native of Akron, Ohio, James began his professional career when Cleveland made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 draft.\n\nThe Lakers have missed the playoffs for a franchise-record five consecutive seasons and failed in their attempts to lure the All-Star free agent Paul George away from the Oklahoma City Thunder. They have also been stymied in their efforts to convince the San Antonio Spurs to trade them the All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard, but none of that mattered in the end when it came to James."

			"text": "Pentecostal and prosperity gospel preachers, whose denominations have the lowest average income and educational attainment in the country, were more likely to support Mr. Trump. Just as a Catholic priest at a wealthy parish would be accustomed to overlooking his parishioners\u2019 discreet reliance on contraception (a respectable practice his Church condemns as immoral), these religious leaders were used to saying that people with messy lives now could make good.\n\nCompare members of Mr. Trump\u2019s Evangelical Advisory Board to attendees at a recent conference of Trump skeptics at Wheaton College, the elite Evangelical institution. Mr. Trump\u2019s board is overwhelmingly drawn from the Southern Baptist Convention and various Pentecostal and prosperity gospel churches. Figures at the Wheaton conference were more likely to be from Presbyterian churches, or conservative offshoots of the Episcopal Church.\n\nThese denominational differences reflect a class divide. About 35 percent of Episcopalians and 25 percent of Presbyterians have a family income above $100,000. Only 16 percent of Southern Baptists and 10 percent of the pentecostal Assemblies of God can say the same. An Episcopalian is more likely to have an advanced degree than a Southern Baptist is to have a college diploma.\n\nBaffling as it may be to elites, Mr. Trump embodies a real if imperfect model of family values. People familiar with the purple family model tend to view his alienation from his children\u2019s mother as normal and his closeness to his children as exceptional and admirable. I saw this among my acquaintances in Nebraska. Even those from red families were more likely than my acquaintances in New York to know someone who has had a child out of wedlock or is subject to a restraining order.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s purple family values may even explain some of his populist appeal. Global leaders like Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker appear to have stable and loving marriages. But their childlessness makes them worse exemplars of family values in the eyes of some non-elites than divorcees who have multiple children \u2014 a category that includes Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s far-right League party, and Marine Le Pen, of France\u2019s National Rally party, as well as Donald Trump. Contempt for elite respectability is reflected not only in the respective party platforms, but in the personal lives of these populist leaders.\n\nIn her speech to the 1992 Republican Convention, Barbara Bush said, \u201cHowever you define family, that\u2019s what we mean by family values.\u201d Debates over Mr. Trump show that different ideas of family are not so easily reconciled."

He\u2019s the only person in Maryland with four statues and two museums dedicated to him, one of which you can visit with Mr. Fields.\n\nBut the most interesting part of the tour was seeing a row of houses Douglass bought late in life in the 1890s. Accounts seem to show they were money-losers, but they are built on the same ground as the demolished Methodist church where Douglass found spirituality in his youth; it was the first place he had returned to in Baltimore when slavery ended, 26 years after he had left.\n\nStreet Wisdom\n\nThe biggest lessons I learned in Charm City, though, all came from people I met by chance. Walking toward Inner Harbor, I heard a beautiful voice singing behind me. Keith Stanford, 28, was 10 days out of prison; he plans to try out for \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d He had gotten into gangs, he said, and wanted to set a good example for his son, and even seemed grateful for his stint because it kept him off the streets last year when Baltimore\u2019s murder rate was the highest in the country. \u201cI think everything happens for a reason,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother night, I got in a Lyft driven by a woman named Andrea Neal, who I wished I could take with me on this trip for motivational pep talks. I told her how much trouble I was having with the writing part of this job, and she told me that the best thing I could do was surrender control and follow God\u2019s guidance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about perfection. There is none,\u201d she said. \u201cLet God intervene and create a wonderful masterpiece out of what you\u2019re doing, so you can give him credit. He just wants the credit.\u201d\n\nMy last night in town, I wound up in the car of Adrian Smith, another Lyft driver, who spends his days cooking in a nursing home. He was happy about some of the city\u2019s changes, but had issues with a rerouting of bus lines that made it harder for people outside of downtown to get to work. Then he showed me the 14-inch Rambo knife he keeps in his car, and the finger he can\u2019t lift because he cut a ligament throwing a potential robber out the window. \u201cI got to do what I got to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 40 years old. I got two kids and a wife. You want to know what Baltimore is? People like myself that hustle. We\u2019re survivors.\u201d Survivors who carry knives at all times? \u201cWelcome to Baltimore,\u201d he said.\n\nPractical Tips\n\n\u2014 I returned my rental car after a day; parking was expensive and I am too much of a wimp for Baltimore driving. Public transportation is as bad as locals say. Walking in the daytime and doing rideshares at night worked out for me. Don\u2019t skip a hike up Federal Hill for beautiful views of the harbor.\n\n\u2014 A Baltimore visit wouldn\u2019t be complete without a trip to the American Visionary Art Museum, dedicated to self-taught artists, and encompassing the beating heart of weirdness that gave us the director John Waters, a Baltimore native. Covered in an elaborate mosaic of mirrors, the building has a glittery, twirling, 10-foot-tall sculpture of drag queen Divine, by the British artist Andrew Logan and an impressive Pez dispenser collection featuring three versions of Elvis."

I hear you.\n\nI\u2019ve never bought into the idea that we shouldn\u2019t write about candidates simply because \u201cthey will never get elected.\u201d A major factor for us \u2014 and this isn\u2019t some excuse \u2014 is resources: We have so many political stories and races and candidates to cover, and a limited number of reporters and editors, so we have to make tough choices. We are often drawn to the campaigns that are the most competitive, that would resonate with a wide spectrum of readers, or where the outcomes could have major ramifications on people\u2019s lives, on issues, on the balance of power, etc.\n\nBut we are always looking for compelling candidates who tell us something important about the nature of their part of the nation or about a policy, idea or ideology and would make for a great read or visual story. If you want to share more thoughts on this, or flag specific compelling candidates that we may be missing, please email me: pdh@nytimes.com.\n\nThanks, Patrick\n\nLessons from 2016\n\nHow will you cover 2018 without the repeat of the 2016 errors and continue on with what I have read as really strong journalism since 2017?\n\n\u2014 Patty McLoone\n\nHi, Patty. Thanks for this. Our colleagues in Washington have done a terrific job covering the Trump presidency, the Mueller investigation and the extraordinary developments at the White House and in Congress. Reporters on our National and Business staffs have captured so many of the changes, challenges and struggles across America, from daily life, education, immigration and health care to the changing economic fortunes for families and voters.\n\nOne of our 2018 goals is to collaborate extensively with these colleagues to tell a really complete story about all facets of life in America and how politics expresses itself in this country.\n\nI was a senior reporter on the 2016 campaign coverage, and I am proud of the work that our team did. By the end of that campaign, I think voters who read our coverage of Trump and Clinton were extremely well-informed about whom these candidates were, what they stood for and what kind of president each would be.\n\nI hope to deliver that kind of insightful coverage again, and to build on it by providing the smartest, most nuanced and accurate picture of the country and its voters."

In recent years, she noted, areas that had not previously experienced problems have flooded.\n\nThe national flood program says 20 percent of claims are paid in areas considered low risk.\n\n\u201cWhere it can rain,\u201d Mr. Maurstad said, \u201cit can flood.\u201d\n\nCost of coverage varies, but the average annual federal flood premium for 2018 increased by 8 percent to $935, according to FEMA. Mr. Maurstad noted that policies for homes in low-risk areas cost around $500. Premiums in high-risk areas, however, can run to four or five figures, Ms. Bach noted.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about flood insurance:\n\nWhat does a federal flood policy cover?\n\nNational Flood Insurance Program policies cover up to $250,000 in damage to the home\u2019s structure, and $100,000 for its contents. (Extra coverage may be bought from private insurers.) But federal policies generally don\u2019t cover living expenses, like the cost of temporary housing.\n\nHow can I keep my flood insurance premium affordable?\n\nHomeowners in high-risk areas who take steps to protect their properties, such as by elevating mechanical systems or even the entire home, can see as much as a 60 percent reduction in premiums, according to FEMA. The agency offers grants to help cover the cost of elevating homes, but the process can take time. So interested consumers should apply sooner rather than later, Ms. Bach said. \u201cBe patient.\u201d\n\nOther suggestions for reducing flood insurance costs are available on FEMA\u2019s website.\n\nWhat happens if Congress doesn\u2019t vote on the flood program by the new deadline?"

It was a misguided attempt to demonstrate that words are not just words, and pictures are not just pictures. I apologize for it, and have replaced the photo.\n\nThere was a behind-the-scenes discussion regarding Peter Gordon\u2019s crossword, which is why I\u2019m writing about it rather than Deb Amlen, the Wordplay editor.\n\nShe was so disenchanted with the puzzle\u2019s gun theme \u2014 especially in this era of widespread violence \u2014 that she didn\u2019t feel she could give it a fair write-up.

So I thought that it would be better for you to hear from Will today. \u2014 D.A.]\n\nI respect that, so I am writing today\u2019s column, instead .\n\nI liked the puzzle because of the freshness and simplicity of the idea and the elegance in the way it was done. Also, I\u2019m a sucker for interlocking theme answers, so the symmetrical RIDE SHOTGUN (19A) and RIFLE THROUGH (59A) running through the vertical BAZOOKA BUBBLE GUM (7D) was a big plus. It\u2019s so rare when this works out. The revealer of TRIGGER / WARNING (26D/25D) \u2014 using this modern phrase in an unexpected way \u2014 was icing on the cake."

A native of a small city outside of Moscow, she had recently moved to Hamburg, Germany, with a small child, another one on the way, and without any chance of employment. She went there with her husband, who was studying there, but she did not know the language and was surrounded by the constant buzz of a new city, its people and culture.\n\nHer decision to travel to Kolodozero was a much-needed break, even if she didn\u2019t know what to expect. But she had been drawn there by the story of Father Arkady, an Orthodox priest with decidedly unorthodox manner."

The referee blows his whistle, and we are going to penalties!\n\n121\u2019: One Last Chance for Spain!\n\nRodrigo gets off a low shot from the top of the box, but Akinfeev easily falls to his side and saves it.\n\n117\u2019: Spain Clears Russian Corner\n\nRussia gets a corner kick but the ball is deflected out of danger. Just a few minutes left for Spain to get a winner here.\n\nIf you are wondering how attacking Russia has been for the last hour and change, the answer is: Not very!\n\n116\u2019: Spain Dodges Trouble\n\nAnother Spanish error almost frees Russia. Pique tried to navigate out of trouble in his own box and loses the ball, but Spain clears.\n\nAndrew Das: Dramatically cooler in here suddenly as the weather changes \u2014 just what the tiring Russians needed. What they needed more was the corner they just won.\n\n114\u2019: Penalty? No.\n\nA beautiful Spanish free kick drifts achingly beyond three Spanish players, and they IMMEDIATELY sprint to referee Bjorn Kuipers to argue that Pique and Ramos were held and deserve a penalty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAndrew Das: That really should have been a penalty for the hold on Ramos. He couldn\u2019t get free of his man and the ball sailed within a few feet of him. Nope. Kuipers waves play on.\n\n112\u2019: Spain Keeps Hammering Away\n\nSpain is generating a good chance every two minutes. If there were an hour left in this game they would surely score, but Russia might be able to hold out for just 10 minutes more.\n\nAndrew Das: Did they chant \u201cRuss-see-ya!\u201d this much in Rocky IV?\n\n111\u2019: Russia Playing for Penalties\n\nRussia with a free kick just inside their own half ... and it is kicked out for a Spanish goal kick. You almost get the sense that Russia doesn\u2019t care one bit about trying to score.\n\nAndrew Das: There is something you have to respect about the stubborn way Spain plays on days like this. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re refusing to change \u2014 flatly refusing \u2014 in the face of overwhelming evidence what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cWe will win our way,\u201d they seem to be saying. \u201cHowever long it takes.\u201d The trust, the belief, inherent in that is admirable. The question is: will it be successful?\n\n109\u2019: Spain on the Attack, but Russia Firm\n\nRodrigo with a beautiful dummy along the sideline, and he sprints forward in the most pulsing move a Spanish player has made all day. But his tight angle shot is blocked by Akinfeev, and Dani Carvajal can\u2019t get a strong shot on the rebound.\n\nAndrew Das: Was that Spain\u2019s best chance to win it before penalties? Maybe. Rodrigo loses his man with a brilliant dummy in the open field, but Carvajal lashed the rebound into a defender. Soooooo close there.\n\n106\u2019: Spain Needs to Push\n\nFifteen more minutes before we go to penalties. A basically 50/50 chance at winning on penalties would be a great outcome for Russia, so perhaps Spain is going to push even higher for a winning goal?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAndrew Das: You have to wonder if the crowd is giving Russia a vital lift here. Let\u2019s be honest: Spain\u2019s the better team, and they\u2019re quicker. But Russia isn\u2019t breaking, isn\u2019t surrendering a yard. And every time they need someone to make a play, he makes it. That\u2019s infectious, especially as this thing goes on and on and on ....\n\n105\u2019: Free Kick for Spain\n\nSpain earns a free kick in the final minute of the first period of extra time, and Pique gets a head to Koke\u2019s ball, but it is straight at Akinfeev.\n\nAndrew Das: Pique\u2019s header is saved and the crowd rises and cheers as one. They really believe now.\n\n102\u2019: Aspas Provides Some Energy\n\nIago Aspas attempted to go one-on-four but his shot was blocked. At least he went for it though!\n\nAndrew Das: The 38-year-old Ignashevich fighting off the substitute Aspas \u2014 twice \u2014 to clear on that break just now is the most tangible sign of how much Russia is willing to give here today. Disciplined, noble effort under sustained pressure. They can be proud, however it ends.\n\n100\u2019: Akinfeev Handles Asensio\n\nMarco Asensio gets a clear shot, but a soft kick from 20 yards out goes right into Igor Akinfeev\u2019s hands.\n\nAndrew Das: Asensio follows up Koke\u2019s long-range attempt with one of his own. Maybe one of those will shake something loose here, but it telegraphs that Spain realizes it might want to score soon rather than leave this to PKs in a hostile stadium. Momentum in those can do funny things.\n\n97\u2019: Koke Lets One Fly\n\nKoke with the most un-Spain moment of the day there, firing off a shot from 35 yards. Maybe he\u2019s had enough, too. That was a frustration ball that landed 35 rows up.\n\n92\u2019: Spain Strikes First\n\nIsco immediately plays a piercing ball through to Aspas who cuts it back for Dani Carvajal, but his shot is blocked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n91\u2019: Who\u2019ll Tire First?\n\nWe are back underway. It is a hot day in Moscow and a few players have cramped up already. This game may come down to one side making a tired mistake.\n\nExtra Time\n\nAs a reminder, for the first time in the World Cup, the teams will be given a fourth substitute to hopefully spice up the extra time period.\n\nAndrew Das: That could be big for Russia, which used its first three early (by the 65th minute).\n\nThe Numbers\n\nPasses in regulation: Spain 854, Russia 227\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And that one\u2019s 1-1.\n\n90 +5\u2019: Extra Time!\n\nSpain gets one last cross in, but it is headed clear, and the referee blows his whistle!\n\nAfter a short break, we\u2019ll have 30 more minutes of Spain passing it among themselves.\n\n90 +3\u2019: Chance for Russia ... Wide\n\nRussia perhaps gets their final chance of regular time, but Fedor Smolov curls his shot well wide.\n\nAndrew Das: The Russian fans are on their feet at the Luzhniki; they think they\u2019ve won the 90 minutes even if they\u2019ve lost the statistics on points, and want to try to steal it here.\n\n90\u2019: Spain Wastes Three Corners\n\nSpain gets three corners in a row, but can\u2019t get a good shot off. The fourth official signals four minutes of extra time.\n\n84\u2019: Two Chances for Spain Blocked\n\nAspas chests a pass back to Iniesta, and his low on-target shot is parried aside. The rebound comes to Aspas, but his shot is dragged wide. Spain looks much more dangerous and direct with Iniesta and Aspas on, making you wonder why it took until the 80th minute for them both to be on.\n\nAndrew Das: Akinfeev may just have kept Russia in the World Cup. Dove right to stop Iniesta\u2019s shot from the top of the area, pushing it right, then scrambled up to paw away Aspas\u2019s follow shot with his left hand. Super play.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n82\u2019: No Hand Ball\n\nThe ensuing corner sort of awkwardly bounces through the box without being touched, though there are appeals for a hand ball. The video assistant referee takes a look, but sees the ball only hit Sergey Ignashevic\u2019s shoulder, not arm.\n\nAndrew Das: That\u2019s a good use of V.A.R. there; Kuipers stops the throw while they look for a hand ball on the replay, but when it shows the ball his Ignashevich in the chest, he takes the V.A.R.\u2019s word and waves play to continue. A few seconds delay to get the call right.\n\n80\u2019: Costa Takes a Seat\n\nSpain makes their final change, and it\u2019s an interesting one. Iago Aspas, who is a sort of hybrid striker/winger, comes in for Diego Costa. He scored the late equalizer against Morocco.\n\nAndrew Das: That\u2019s the most movement we\u2019ve seen from Costa in an hour as he sprints to the sideline to be replaced by Aspas. Hierro really needed to do something, or at least send on someone will to run around a bit more, cause some confusion. Let\u2019s hope those were the instructions to Aspas.\n\n76\u2019: Playing Keepaway\n\nSpain currently running the world\u2019s largest, most boring rondo: just encircling a Russian team that doesn\u2019t seem to be trying too hard to get the ball back. It is as if Spain thinks the first team to 1,000 passes automatically wins.\n\n72\u2019: Spain Gives It Away\n\nA long Koke pass goes high over Marco Asensio\u2019s head and out of bounds, which is a good metaphor of how dangerous Spain\u2019s attack has been.\n\nAndrew Das: Spain still looks like it\u2019s going to have to pass its way through a picket fence here; all the possession lately is around the outside, ringing the Russians but not probing the center. That\u2019s fine for keepaway. It\u2019s significantly harder to score a goal that way, though, especially if the Russians refuse to be drawn out of their compact shape. \u201cWant the ball way out wide?\u201d they seem to be saying. \u201cGo ahead, have the ball outside.\u201d\n\n71\u2019: Yellow for Zobnin\n\nJordi Alba is taken down by Roman Zobnin, who gets a yellow card for his troubles.\n\n70\u2019: Spain Turns to Dani Carvajal\n\nRight back Nacho makes way for Dani Carvajal, who started each of the last two games.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAndrew Das: It\u2019s amazing how Spain never seems to run out of Real Madrid or Barcelona players to bring on.\n\n67\u2019: Iniesta Replaces Silva for Spain\n\nIt\u2019s David Silva who makes way for Iniesta.\n\nAndrew Das: Silva didn\u2019t really show much today. If anyone can sort Spain out, create something out of nothing, it\u2019s probably Iniesta.\n\nIniesta, 34, is surely in his last World Cup. And after all he\u2019s won, he absolutely does not want to go out to Russia in the round of 16.\n\n65\u2019: Russia Takes Off Dzyuba\n\nRussia makes their final substitution, taking off goal scorer Artem Dzyuba for Fedor Smolov. Spain still has all three of their substitutions left, but Andres Iniesta is coming on shortly.\n\nAndrew Das: Russia has used all three of its subs now. They\u2019ve also grabbed a bit more of the momentum, though they\u2019ve still been out-passed today by nearly three to one. Last I checked, Spain had completed about 600 passes, Russian just under 200.\n\n64\u2019: Costa Offside\n\nDiego Costa thought he had a little breakaway going against the Russian defense, but the offside flag is up. He just know it.\n\n62\u2019: Russia Brings on Cheryshev\n\nHere comes Denis Cheryshev, on for Aleksandr Samedov at attacking midfielder. Cheryshev has played in Spain since he was 12, and would love to score against this team full of Real Madrid and Barcelona players.\n\n60\u2019: Silva Misses\n\nA great chance for Spain and David Silva. He creates a little bit of space to get his head on a cross, but sends it wide of the left post.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n59\u2019: Corner for Spain\n\nDiego Costa gets a nice through ball behind the defense, but his cutback is blocked out. Russia clears the subsequent corner away.\n\n56\u2019: Not Quite the Classic Spain\n\nSpain looks like a version of classic Spain that has been run through the copier. It\u2019s definitely Spain, but they\u2019re lacking the edge, the detail and the definition that made them Spain.\n\nIt\u2019s not possession to intentionally lull Russia to sleep, or possession that is constantly probing for openings. It\u2019s possession that isn\u2019t creative enough to regularly trouble Russia.\n\n50\u2019: Will Spain Attack?\n\nFor Russia, the plan is simple: Keep doing what they\u2019re doing. For Spain, the decision is much harder: When, if ever, do they try something new? Spain has always been supremely confident in sticking to their game plan, assuming the goal is coming eventually. But they could go more direct to Diego Costa, or bring players like Andres Iniesta, Thiago or Iago Aspas off the bench.\n\n48\u2019: Spain Changes Strategy\n\nSpain immediately on the attack, with Isco doing most of the hard work. The ball eventually skips to a wide open Jordi Alba, but it\u2019s at an awkward height and he\u2019s only able to thrust a quadriceps at it.\n\n46\u2019: Russia Makes a Change\n\nWe are underway! Russia has brought Vladimir Granat on for Yury Zhirkov.\n\nRussia stays in the 5-4-1 though. No change in formation.\n\nHalftime: Spain 1, Russia 1\n\nSpain and Russia go into the half all even 1-1, as the World Cup of strange goals continues. Spain\u2019s came on a free kick own goal, while Russia\u2019s was from a yellow card after a hand ball in the box.\n\nSpain has dominated possession but failed to generate many chances, while Russia has sat back and looked to score on the counter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAndrew Das: Spain must be kicking itself for not pressing harder for a second goal before halftime. They were in total control, and Russia was willing to lie back and take whatever they did. But content in possession, Spain was happy to play keepaway \u2014 a winning strategy unless, you know, you somehow give up the tying goal and let the hosts and the crowd roar back to life.\n\nNow Russia will probably go into the locker room thinking, \u201cYou know .......\u201d\n\n45+2\u2019: Russian Counterattack Fizzles\n\nThe half ends with a Diego Costa header and a Russian counterattack, but neither amount to anything.\n\n45\u2019: Spain Finally Takes a Shot\n\nIn the final minute of the first half, Spain takes their first shot. It\u2019s from Marco Asensio outside the box, and it is blocked.\n\n43\u2019: Spain\u2019s Shaky Defense\n\nSpain\u2019s defense has been uncharacteristically error-prone this World Cup, but at some point it stops being uncharacteristic and is simply the reality of the situation: David de Gea\u2019s fumbled shot in the opener, Ramos and Iniesta\u2019s miscommunication against Morocco and now Pique\u2019s hand ball for a goal here.\n\n41\u2019: GOAL! Russia Equalizes\n\nArtem Dzyuba slams the ball into the corner as de Gea dives the wrong way. The Moscow stadium sounds deafening.\n\nStrange arguments from Spain over the penalty: Pique rose with his arm over his head. Even with his back turned, that\u2019s an unnatural position that\u2019s indefensible when he got an advantage from it. The score is even, though the game surely has not been.\n\n40\u2019: Penalty!\n\nPenalty kick for Russia! Big Artem Dzyuba rose highest on the corner kick, and headed the ball off of Gerard Pique\u2019s arm, which was sticking up straight in the air.\n\n39\u2019: Russia Takes Control\n\nAll of a sudden Russia is on the front foot, and Spain\u2019s defense looks unorganized. Russian corner coming up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n36\u2019: Chance Russia!\n\nSergio Ramos was unable to deal with a high ball, eventually giving Aleksandr Golovin a shot from 15 yards out, but he curls the ball wide of a diving David de Gea and wide of the post.\n\n32\u2019: Spain Spreads Out\n\nSpain is really trying to stretch Russia out, with Jordi Alba and Nacho practically stuck to the sidelines, and Sergio Ramos pinging balls from sideline to sideline.\n\n28\u2019: Russia Should Go to the Air\n\nIf Russia can get some high balls into the box, they would seemingly have an advantage. Forward Artem Dzyuba is enormous, and outside of Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique, Spain doesn\u2019t really have height or physicality at the back.\n\nAndrew Das: The crowd is turning on Spain\u2019s possession now, whistling as they just toy with the Russians. But Russia isn\u2019t doing much to change the game here, either. Current pass count on that last stoppage: Spain 231, Russia 58. It\u2019s going to get worse.\n\n22\u2019: Spain Leads Without Taking a Shot\n\nRussia\u2019s defense is actually performing quite well. Spain has yet to take a shot, and haven\u2019t really had any dangerous chances except for the free kick. Too bad that free kick resulted in a goal.\n\n17\u2019: Now Russia Must Push\n\nAt some point Russia will have to open up in search of a tying goal, but when will that be? Probably not until the second half.\n\n14\u2019: Russia Gets a Chance\n\nRoman Zobnin sees an opening and takes it from midrange. His shot sails over the bar.\n\nPhoto\n\n12\u2019: GOAL! Spain Leads\n\nSergio Ramos was defended 1-on-1 at the back post on the free kick, and it looked like he managed to get a foot on the ball while practically being tackled.\n\nOn replay, that will be ruled a Sergey Ignashevich own goal. Ramos was swinging at it, but the ball ultimately bounced off the back of Ignashevich\u2019s leg and in. I suppose the lesson here is to not turn your back to the ball while tackling the attacker on a free kick. That\u2019s the second own goal for Russia in this tournament.\n\nAndrew Das: Ramos will claim that goal, scored while he and Ignashevich fell together at the back post. Tough break \u2014 Ignashevich knew nothing of it \u2014 but fair for Spain, which has dominated so far. That\u2019s the 10th own goal of the tournament by the way, a World Cup record. Far and away the leader for the Golden Boot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n10\u2019: Free Kick for Spain\n\nYuri Zhirkov\u2019s rough challenge draws a foul from the referee Bjorn Kuipers. Spain will have a dangerous free kick from the wing, as soon as Nacho gets some treatment for taking studs in the leg.\n\n7\u2019: Spain Keeps Possession\n\nSo far the game is playing to type. Spain has all of the possession and is attempting to unlock the Russian defense with quick movement and passing, while the one time Russia got the ball they made a break for it and earned a corner.\n\nAndrew Das: Spain in complete control in the first 10 minutes, just passing the ball back and forth, around and around, and probing that back five when there\u2019s a chance. When Russia does break, the crowd roars, and Golovin even won a corner at one point. But Russia did nothing with it, and we\u2019re right back to Spain on the ball. The possession stats are going to be wildly lopsided today\n\n5\u2019: Zhirkov Fires First\n\nYuri Zhirkov grabs a rebound and lets one fly from long range. Spain gets a body on it. No threat.\n\n3\u2019: Russia Heavy in the Back\n\nRussia has an ultra-defensive setup. They are starting 5 defenders at the back, and their breakout star of this World Cup, Denis Cheryshev, is on the bench. He started the tournament on the bench, but came into the first game early after Alan Dzagoev\u2019s injury.\n\nAndrew Das: Russia is playing five across the back today, with the 38-year-old Sergey Ignashevich holding down the center. Diego Costa already has set up shop in his living room.\n\n3\u2019: Spain Probing\n\nJordi Alba tries to take it himself for Spain, but Russia\u2019s defense deals with him quickly.\n\nKickoff!\n\nWe are underway! Spain is in red, hosts Russia are in white, and 80,000 fans are in Luzhniki Stadium to cheer them on.\n\nAndrew Das: Today\u2019s referee is a veteran Dutchman, Bjorn Kuipers. He\u2019ll know the Spanish players from European games."

			"text": "Mr. Pape\u2019s folksy manner delivers down-home truths: Don\u2019t get swept up in trendy investments; pay off your debts; analyze how banks are managing your money. As a result, it\u2019s uncontroversial with experts. Chris Richardson, an economist at Deloitte in Canberra, said that Mr. Pape\u2019s major tenets, like his argument that Australians have generally overvalued property and undervalued stock trading \u201care more real then people realize.\u201d\n\nAnother cornerstone of the Barefoot Investor\u2019s plan that resonates with economists is the importance of renegotiating bank fees, which, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, run to 480 Australian dollars, around $355, a household per year. \u201cOver ten years,\u201d Mr. Pape writes, that\u2019s \u201cenough to take you to New York City and stay at a five-star hotel.\u201d\n\nBank fees are lower in the United States; in Australia, just four banks represent about 80 percent of the total share of the market. \u201cWe certainly have high market concentration by international standards,\u201d said Danielle Wood, an economist at the Grattan Institute, a public policy think tank in Melbourne. Ms. Wood sees high bank fees as a result of status quo bias, or the tendency to accept things the way they are, perhaps understandable for a country doing so well economically. \u201cI think the message of the Barefoot Investor gets traction because he encourages people to think about things, and think about why they\u2019re paying too much,\u201d she said.\n\nJackie Frankel, a 47-year-old factory worker from Australia\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, is a zealous Barefooter, as Mr. Pape\u2019s fans are known. She concedes that her two grown daughters don\u2019t completely understand his appeal. \u201cThey say to me, it\u2019s common sense stuff to figure out what you owe, but I say people need it in black and white,\u201d Ms. Frankel said. After reading the book, she and her husband, who also works in a factory, started going out for \u201cdate breakfasts.\u201d (Nights were out because of their shifts.) After talking it through over eggs, they moved their money from one of the \u201cbig four\u201d banks to an online-only account recommended by name in Mr. Pape\u2019s book. (He says that he does not accept any endorsements, and will pull a recommendation if he sees a company using his name in advertising.) \u201cWe saved $500 a month just doing that, and now we\u2019re going to New Zealand on a cruise,\u201d Ms. Frankel said.\n\nAustralians love to travel internationally: about 60 percent hold passports, compared with around 40 percent of Americans. Mr. Pape doesn\u2019t come across as abstemious about these sorts of big-ticket expenses. Instead, he advocates for letting the good times roll by divvying money into \u201cbuckets.\u201d This approach ensures daily expenses are separated from \u201csplurges,\u201d like lattes, and \u201csmile\u201d purchases, which, like vacations, make you smile when you think of them. Call it the set and forget principle of money management.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea that you\u2019ve got to get down to the bare bones and have no fun,\u201d said Ali Cusack, a 31-year-old lawyer in Melbourne. \u201cHe just says, build it into your budget.\u201d Ms. Cusack has been to Europe each summer for the past two years and recently started her own maritime law practice. \u201cI got so ridiculously good at saving money that I didn\u2019t even need to take out a loan to start my own business,\u201d she said."

The peculiar mating rituals, the doomed drones who wait all their lives for a single sexual encounter with an omnipotent queen, leading to immediate death. As humans, we find them fascinating: perhaps the only species whose gender politics are more screwed up than our own.\n\nIn \u201cThe Honey Farm,\u201d the debut novel by the Canadian writer Harriet Alida Lye, the inner workings of a bee colony become an eerie metaphor for communal living gone awry. At the center of the novel is Silvia, a recent university graduate who replies to an exuberant online ad for \u201cTHE HONEY FARM. Free retreat for artists, writers, thinkers!\u201d It\u2019s unclear which category Silvia belongs to, but she is nonetheless offered room and board in exchange for work on the farm.\n\nIt seems, at first, an idyllic setting: Think Yaddo with bees. Running the show is the mysterious Cynthia, the farm\u2019s proprietor and queen bee, who supervises the chores that occupy most of the day. The residents \u2014 two brothers who make documentary films, a French Canadian artist couple and Ibrahim, a driven young painter from Toronto, among others \u2014 are shocked to find that the farm has no internet access, no cellphone signal. Its only link to the outside world is a phone booth at the end of the lane.\n\nImage\n\nIt\u2019s a satisfying setup, reminiscent of an Agatha Christie mystery, the entire cast of characters marooned together in an exotic locale. Strange events ensue. Silvia drinks from a garden hose and finds the water blood-colored. The group is afflicted with head lice. A swim in a murky pond disturbs an unimaginable number of frogs, which soon infiltrate the house. The incidents seem related to an unprecedented drought that\u2019s making the bees anxious. Clearly, evil is afoot."

She was 85.\n\nHer friend Marc Rosen, who confirmed the death, said the cause was colon cancer.\n\nMs. Montevecchi was 50 and a runaway from American film and television when she was cast in \u201cNine,\u201d the 1982 Broadway musical drama about a film director\u2019s midlife crisis, based on the Federico Fellini film \u201c8\u00bd.\u201d\n\nThe role of the movie producer had been written for a man, but the character was reworked so Ms. Montevecchi, who didn\u2019t fit anywhere else in the show, could be cast. In \u201cFolies Berg\u00e8re,\u201d her big number, she reveled in the joys of the good old days of show business, stopped to chat flirtatiously with audience members and ended up gloriously wrapped in a 30-foot-long black feather boa.\n\nFrank Rich\u2019s review in The New York Times described her as \u201ca knockout \u2014 a glorious amalgam of music-hall feistiness and balletic grace, with Toulouse-Lautrec shadows about the eyes.\u201d She received the Tony for best featured actress in a musical, beating two of her own \u201cNine\u201d co-stars, Karen Akers and Anita Morris."

			"text": "At the age of 80, the sculptor Wendell Dayton is having his first major show, a six-decade survey of his work at the Los Angeles gallery Blum & Poe. Until now, Dayton had mainly exhibited his abstract creations in a sculpture park of his own making, in the unassuming corner of the San Fernando Valley where he lives and works. The brittle yellow grass of the two-acre lawn surrounding his low-slung white house is dotted with abstract monuments assembled from sheets of stainless steel. Some of the pieces are almost 50 years old, yet Dayton\u2019s conservation routine is blissfully minimal \u2014 the beauty of stainless steel is that it never rusts. \u201cIt just flies along, man,\u201d Dayton says in his surfer drawl, which belies his Pacific Northwest roots.\n\nGrowing up in Spokane, Washington, Dayton had aspirations to be a sign painter, but after reading a book on Paul Gauguin, he decided to become an artist. He completed his B.F.A. at the University of Indiana in 1960 and hitchhiked to New York City, a hotbed of not only creative energy but also tangible source material. Inspired by Jasper Johns \u2014 \u201ca true junk artist,\u201d says Dayton \u2014 he made his early work using refuse scavenged from junkyards. His love of Alexander Calder and Jean Tinguely made its way into his sculpture, too; he was fond of slicing open tin cans and steel drums and letting the metal unravel into wayward spirals. When fellow artist James Rosenquist introduced him to Robert Scull, the collector supplied Dayton with his first stainless steel. \u201cScull must have bought me a ton, and man, I used it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was making up to three sculptures a day.\u201d"

That may take a while, though, so for the time being, that link will be at the very beginning of each column, where it tells you which day\u2019s puzzle we\u2019re discussing.\n\nAnd, on another note: If you haven\u2019t seen the title and instructions for this puzzle because you\u2019re solving online, the title is the headline here and you are instructed, \u201cAfter completing this puzzle, draw a line starting at the middle square of 59-Across and connect five appropriate squares in roughly clockwise order to reveal an image suggested by this puzzle\u2019s theme.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first Summer Sunday of 2018 everybody (in the Northern Hemisphere)! Some people live for this time of year \u2014 you might be one of them, clinging to a rock surface right now, setting up a tent, kite sailing, trying to keep your puzzle dry while you hang ten on a surfboard. Or you may see it as the season of poison ivy, yellow jackets, sunburn and any number of other hazards waiting for us when we go outdoors, in hardly any clothes, and attempt to enjoy some balmy goodness without coming to grievous harm. Or, you may spend the whole season inside, in climate-controlled safety, getting your kicks from weather-independent activities, which are legion these days (but weren\u2019t always).\n\nWhatever your approach to summer, Timothy Polin\u2019s puzzle is for you.

But top-tier artists today increasingly avoid middlemen \u2014 and leaks \u2014 in the production, promotion and even delivery of their albums. (Kanye West, for example, seemed to finish \u201cYe\u201d just hours before his Wyoming listening party and release in June.)\n\n\u201cBefore, you used to have to finish an album, give it to the label, have them send it to a CD plant, and it would take weeks or months to package an album,\u201d said Joe Coscarelli, a pop music reporter for The Times. \u201cNow there\u2019s this system where the most powerful artists can basically deliver their finished work directly to streaming services hours before it\u2019s online.\u201d\n\nThe secrecy prevents leaks and keeps fans on their toes, but it can also make reporting on the albums tricky.\n\nUnlike a music critic or a writer who analyzes culture, Mr. Coscarelli does not take a personal stance on Ms. Knowles\u2019s albums. He reports on them as breaking news, pulling together the details of the drop and the most newsworthy lyrics.\n\nHe\u2019s learned to look for signs of an impending drop \u2014 a big event with opportunity for a dramatic release (like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 Super Bowl performance; the song \u201cFormation\u201d dropped the day before), appropriate timing (\u201cEverything Is Love\u201d dropped just before the North America leg of the On the Run II concert tour), or tips from his sources. Ms. Wortham had been waiting for the third part of a trilogy.\n\nMr. Coscarelli keeps notifications turned on for relevant Twitter and Instagram accounts, including those affiliated with Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z and Tidal, as well as fan accounts (like the @Bey_Legion Twitter page, which posted a sign from the concert in London announcing the album\u2019s release).\n\nStill, Ms. Knowles doesn\u2019t follow the typical industry rules.\n\n\u201cAt this point, new music comes out at midnight on Thursday,\u201d Mr. Coscarelli said. And so, the week \u201cEverything Is Love\u201d dropped, after hearing vague musings that something might come out, he was ready and waiting until midnight on Thursday, and then until midnight on Friday, and then much of Saturday, at which point he thought it was a false alarm."

			"text": "But it ultimately wears you down. If snoring doesn\u2019t drive you to the doctor, fatigue may. Still, many power through, gradually becoming too tired to perform their jobs well or safely. Untreated train, bus and truck drivers clearly pose a significant public safety risk.\n\nDefinitively diagnosing the condition requires a sleep test \u2014 either at home, or more extensively in a lab. Getting wired up for bed isn\u2019t much fun, which is another reason people may avoid seeking a diagnosis. Professional drivers and train operators also may worry that doing so could threaten their livelihood. To dodge screens for the condition, they may underreport feeling drowsy.\n\nThere may also be fear of sleep apnea treatments. The gold standard for treatment is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, which forces the airway open with pressure delivered through a mask. The prospect of sleeping with a mask, and next to a machine, can be off-putting and, for some, uncomfortable. Compliance with treatment is about 60 percent. But the devices have become far more comfortable and quiet over the years. (The newest models are entirely silent.)\n\nFor obese patients, losing weight can reverse sleep apnea. But keeping the weight off is notoriously hard.\n\nOther options include oral appliances (think of them as fancy mouth guards), nasal patches and, for extreme cases, surgery. Costs for devices can range from hundreds of dollars to thousands. Even at the high end, you may feel a considerable boost in quality of life that could be worth the cost.\n\nAlthough these options work for snoring, too, insurance won\u2019t cover them for that condition. Similar over-the-counter oral appliances are cheaper, but less extensively studied, making it hard to say for whom they will work well. Studies document that patients use over-the-counter versions less, perhaps because they may be less comfortable than professionally customized ones. So, although snoring is highly curable, the cost and uncertainty of exactly how to do so may be a barrier for many to treat it.\n\nThere\u2019s a public safety interest in treating sleep apnea more widely. Yet last summer, in an effort to reduce regulations, the Trump administration withdrew a proposed rule that would have required drivers of trucks and buses, as well as railroad engineers, to be tested for the condition. This may be one area where a little more regulation is warranted."

			"text": "Fly on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday\n\nLike any other industry, airline flight prices depend on supply and demand. Prices are cheaper when there\u2019s less demand, and that\u2019s typically during the week, said James Filsinger, president and chief executive of Yapta, a website that tracks airfare and hotel prices. \u201cInstead of flying with the masses on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday, travel on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday and you\u2019ll find that prices are lower,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially, do your best to \u2018zig\u2019 when the rest of the travel population \u2018zags,\u2019 and you\u2019ll find that travel is not as costly.\u201d\n\nFor the same reason, flights are usually cheaper on holidays, but significantly more expensive on the days before and after the holiday. You can save a considerable amount of cash flying on Thanksgiving, for example, instead of the Tuesday before. Of course, the downside is that you will have to travel on a holiday, but the upside is beating the crowds.\n\nTrack your Flight and Get Price Drop Alerts\n\nOn the other hand, airline fare pricing is a science that can be tough to predict, said Mr. Kelly. \u201cBetween availability, airline revenue managers, when you\u2019re traveling and more, there are so many moving parts to airfare that you can\u2019t really focus on one too much.\u201d\n\nA better option: find tools to do the work for you. Online tools like Yapta, Hopper and Google Flights allow you to search for flights, then keep track of them through their interface or even via email alerts. If a flight drops or increases in price, you\u2019ll get a notification.\n\nMix and Match Airlines and Airports\n\nWhen booking your round-trip flight, search for two separate one-way tickets, too, possibly on different airlines. \u201cInstead of buying a round-ticket on one carrier, piece together two one-way tickets on two different carrier,\u201d said Scott Steinberg, the founder of SELECT CITY, an online travel magazine. \u201cSometimes, the overall price is less expensive for two one-way tickets instead of one round-trip ticket,\u201d he added. Many flight search sites like the ones we\u2019ve mentioned will automatically do this for you, or let you switch between area airports if a flight into one and out of another is less expensive.\n\nThis might also come in handy if you need to cancel just one leg of your flight. For example, if you\u2019re flying to London, but your departure date changes, it may be cheaper to pay a cancel fee for your one-way departing ticket than to cancel and rebook your entire round-trip flight. Of course, this also depends on how the airline handles flight changes. Also, if you end up extending your trip to stay in your destination city longer, it may be easier to make a change when you book separate tickets.\n\nIt may also be cheaper to fly into or out of an alternative airport. If you\u2019re flying into Los Angeles, for example, don\u2019t limit your search to LAX. Search for flights to and from surrounding airports, like Burbank. Just make sure they\u2019re not too far out of the way of your destination, otherwise you could find yourself on a mini road-trip from the airport to your hotel."

Though the accusations against famous men were in one sense far from the people I saw, they were relevant to the questions they often brought to therapy. Why did they so misunderstand the women in their lives? Why were they often being accused of hurting them?\n\nOne man, a third-year medical resident, told me he saw himself in Mr. Ansari. Friendly but shy, he yearned to find a meaningful relationship but struggled to connect with women. He\u2019d been experimenting with approaching women in a more \u201cdominant\u201d and assertive way, since he\u2019d heard that\u2019s what women wanted. He had made an aggressive move on a prospective date and was told that his approach was creepy.\n\nSitting on my couch, he could barely look me in the eyes. He confessed that he\u2019d spent much of the weekend just lying in bed. He eventually acknowledged that he had been so focused on performing for dates that he wasn\u2019t really connecting to them, unable to accurately read his date\u2019s reactions. He was focused on tuning out his own discomfort and was unaware of the feelings of the woman in front of him.\n\nThe majority of men who enter my office appear either flat and emotionless or superficially engaged but hiding behind impenetrable niceness. When I ask a man, for example, how he feels when his girlfriend says, \u201cI\u2019m so upset, I can\u2019t even be around you right now,\u201d I usually get an answer like \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201d That\u2019s a word that is used a lot yet conveys essentially nothing. Most men have spent little time with their feelings and have very limited vocabulary to describe what is going on in their hearts."

In your mind\u2019s eye, you know that there\u2019s color and all, but you don\u2019t need to see color. These images capture something else, a mood.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Mr. Henderson\u2019s photography has grown broad in gesture, humming with sublime symbolism: a woman with her hands on her hips who stands watching over her brood on a porch in midcentury Virginia is a vivid image of a mother\u2019s love; a black ballerina in repose before a traditional frieze is a contrast in beauty, then and now; and a picture of Muhammad Ali at a news conference surrounded by the Jackson 5\u2019s star presence, is an outsize sign of black power. Exposing the contractions of wealth is a somber 1968 scene of a lone civil rights protester sitting outside a sea of tents at \u201cResurrection City,\u201d the encampment the Poor People\u2019s Campaign set up in the shadow of the Washington Monument to shame a nation.\n\nMr. Henderson sees these photos as \u201ca part of the American landscape,\u201d that make a statement linking past and present. \u201cIt\u2019s just capturing the things you see in the street that could be very easily overlooked by most people,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of us, we\u2019re not looking for photographs as we walk around. But my motivation as a photographer and an artist is to be able to see the things that other people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like fishing, you\u2019ve got a fishing line in the water and you really dig in and see what you can catch.

Rising floodwaters in the cave had stalled the search-and-rescue operation for days.\n\nGiven how long the boys and their coach have been missing, the odds of finding them alive seemed to be growing thin. But the governor of Chiang Rai Province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, who is overseeing the search-and-rescue operation, expressed hope that Thai Navy SEAL divers could soon reach the cavern where the group is believed to be.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy with the result,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cThe water level is reduced, and it makes it easier for the SEALs.\u201d"

Is there a difference?\n\nThis question gets asked a lot, and I believe the differences can vary from week to week. Mostly, I think it has to do with the theme and how hard you have to think to put it all together. A Monday theme might be a set of phrases that all have some commonality, but on a Tuesday, there may be hidden elements that solvers need to unearth.\n\nSome of it has to do with the level of cluing, although solvers will still see mostly straightforward clues on a Tuesday. On a Tuesday, there are still a good number of fill-in-the-blank clues, which help solvers gain that all-important foothold in a puzzle. But solvers will begin to see odd-looking clues that they will have to parse, like 41A\u2019s \u201c[U r hilarious].\u201d Just a slight challenge that requires more thinking, but once you learn the trick \u2014 check out the \u201cBracket Clues\u201d section of our guide \u2014 solving gets much easier.\n\nWhich is to say that once you understand what the clues are asking of you and you begin to feel that there is no real difference between a Monday and a Tuesday puzzle, you\u2019ll know that your solving skills have taken a leap forward and you are ready for the mid-to-late-week puzzles."

Martin, dean of the university\u2019s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. The university formed an \u201cengagement team\u201d that included academics, student leadership and public safety officers in a dialogue with those who organized the talk.\n\n\u201cWe let students know that we were not only fully committed to the right of the speaker to speak, but the audience to hear and the right of those who wanted to express dissent to be able to do so in a way that didn\u2019t preclude others\u2019 rights,\u201d Professor Martin said, speaking on a forum panel.\n\nThere were protests, but \u201cwe have a protocol to deal with this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s called a heckler\u2019s warning.\u201d The protesters were asked to allow the speaker to continue \u201cand we reiterated some of the principles behind that.\u201d After five minutes the students were once again asked to be quiet, or they would be removed by public safety officers. The demonstrators left and the speech continued.\n\nChristina Paxson, president of Brown University, said her university took much the same approach when the conservative pundit Guy Benson spoke there earlier this year.\n\n\u201cYou have to start with discussions with students early and often,\u201d she said, \u201cwith students hosting the event and with groups of students who might be unhappy with the event. That\u2019s 90 percent of the battle.\u201d\n\nMany students don\u2019t understand that the First Amendment only guarantees that no government entity can violate a person\u2019s right to free speech. So private universities, unlike public universities \u2014 which are considered state agents \u2014 are free to punish students for speech without violating the First Amendment. However, many private universities have free speech codes that guarantee their students freedom of speech."

But wood-grilled foods get even more of their distinctive flavor and edge from the fragrant smoke."

You can almost feel enveloped by cool water, and the movement in its expanse within the growing silence.

In December, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters that the president congratulated Mr. Murdoch on the impending Disney deal. In addition, Mr. Trump praises Fox News and its hosts every chance he gets \u2014 and they regularly return the favor. While Disney will not acquire Fox News or the Fox network and stations as part of this deal, the acquisition will make the Murdoch family the largest individual shareholders in Disney, increasing their wealth by billions of dollars.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, will surely argue that the president\u2019s feelings about CNN and Fox News have no bearing on his decisions. But it is mystifying why Mr. Delrahim took such a hard line against AT&T-Time Warner, which legal experts argued would be a difficult case to bring because of the nature of the merger, while going so easy on Disney-Fox.\n\nBy acquiring Time Warner, AT&T was seeking to buy a supplier \u2014 a classic vertical integration move that is hard to challenge because it involves businesses in different parts of an industry. In recent decades, judges have typically concluded that such combinations generate efficiency gains that more than offset any harm they might cause to consumers. That\u2019s why regulators have tended to approve these deals as long as the merging companies agree not to take unfair advantage of their market power.\n\nBy comparison, antitrust regulators and judges are usually much more dubious of horizontal deals like Disney-Fox. In these cases, it\u2019s much easier to show that the combined company would have the power to raise prices and limit choices. In the movie business, for example, Disney already wields considerable clout \u2014 its studios accounted for more than a third of box office sales in the first five months of the year. The additional 15 percent share of box office sales that the company will gain through this deal no doubt will increase Disney\u2019s clout when it negotiates with movie-theater chains. For instance, the company might be able to demand top billing for its movies and a bigger share of revenue than smaller studios get. According to a handful of theater owners who talked to The Wall Street Journal last year, Disney has already engaged in such tactics, forcing them to accept more onerous terms if they wanted to show its blockbuster \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi.\u201d"

Such accidents don\u2019t usually end up on the animated series \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d but that one did \u2014 because Laura Welch went on to marry George W. Bush and become first lady of the United States.\n\nNow the cartoon\u2019s joke serves as title and throughline for the sneakily engaging solo play \u201cLaura Bush Killed a Guy,\u201d at the Flea Theater.\n\nIan Allen\u2019s comedy is divided into three short sections, each one starting with Mrs. Bush (a nicely understated Lisa Hodsoll) lamenting the fact that judging by Google searches, her claims to fame are her Cowboy Cookies recipe and that fateful night in Texas. (For the sake of critical thoroughness, I helped myself to one of the free treats at the theater; it was tasty, even if the coconut-cowboy connection remains murky.)\n\nThe first go-round makes clear that this will not be a standard bio-play, as Mrs. Bush breezily explains that the accident was, in fact, a cover-up for a deliberate murder. Opening the second part, she contends she had been drunk; the third time is a matter-of-fact account of a driving mistake with tragic consequences."

But he was happy among the briquettes and lighter fluid.\n\nHe had invented a basting sauce \u2014 equal parts ketchup and yellow mustard \u2014 which he slathered over burgers and hot dogs, both thoroughly grilled.

Some in Congress, like Representatives Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan, have defended the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation and pushed back against the Spygate narrative. \u201cA confidential informant is not a spy,\u201d says Senator Lindsey Graham, undermining Spygate\u2019s central premise. But others want to take seriously the possibility that candidate Trump fell victim to those same imperial powers that Brennan encouraged Obama to use. \u201cThere is virtually no abuse of civil liberties that John Brennan hasn\u2019t been a part of,\u201d Senator Rand Paul told me by email, citing drone strikes, torture and surveillance. Later, he called on Brennan to testify publicly about \u201cany secret info on candidate Trump ... from European or British intelligence sources.\u201d Brennan\u2019s warnings about Trump seemed at risk of getting lost in the noise, one among many competing sets of allegations.\n\n\u201cI think his credibility is zero,\u201d Brennan said on MSNBC, hours after the North Korea summit. \u201cHe continually lies to the American people and to the public,\u201d he thundered. \u201cHow can anybody believe what he is saying?\u201d His jabs were getting sharper and snappier; he was adapting to a media environment in which points don\u2019t land without repetition and hyperbole. He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump.\n\nBrennan\u2019s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen\u2019s own father, Brennan told me, was \u201ca supporter, an affiliate, say,\u201d of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor. \u201cMy dad worked construction in those years,\u201d Tom remembers. \u201cThose jobs were not easy to come by.\u201d When the construction business slowed down, Owen would find odd jobs. For a time, he commuted into Manhattan to fold papers for The Daily News. The Brennans scrimped so John and his brother and sister could be taught by Franciscan nuns, who made heaven and hell as tangible as two neighborhood subway lines. Brennan resolved to go to heaven, and the priesthood seemed like a sure way of getting there. He read about the popes and noticed that there had never been an American one. He decided that he would be the first. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a priest, why not aspire to be the highest priest there is?\u201d he told me.\n\nAs a teenager, even as he absorbed his parents\u2019 morality and work ethic, Brennan felt torn between the cloistered priesthood and a life of worldly experience, between pleasing his parents and escaping into a world that was larger than New Jersey. He read Saint Augustine and Hermann Hesse. He found a mentor in his cousin Thomas, who had traveled to Malaysia and Vietnam and was stationed in Indonesia, working at U.S.A.I.D. Thomas mailed back reel-to-reel audio recordings recounting his travels. On Sundays, after church, the family would gather around the kitchen table at Thomas\u2019s father\u2019s house to listen to them. Thomas told the family how lucky they were to be living in the free world, where there was adequate food and shelter and real opportunity. John wanted to follow Thomas\u2019s example. He applied to and was accepted by the Georgetown School of Foreign Service but could not attend; the tuition was too high. Instead, he enrolled at Fordham, a Catholic university on the other side of the Hudson. He took the bus to school and worked nights at a supermarket deli. He devoted himself to studying Arabic and spent part of his junior year in Cairo.\n\nA few years later, in 1980, as a graduate student in political science at the University of Texas at Austin, Brennan would write his master\u2019s thesis on the state of human rights in Egypt, under the rule of Anwar Sadat. The thesis grapples with a thorny problem of United States policy in the Middle East \u2014 how much repression by our allies is tolerable? Brennan responded to the problem with equivocation. In his view, Sadat\u2019s repression of radical groups and censoring of the press was justifiable for the sake of \u201cthe preservation of democracy.\u201d Other measures, like interfering with elections, were unjustifiable \u201cregime perpetuation.\u201d In the case of Egypt, he found, the ends do justify the means, but only sometimes.\n\nBack in New Jersey, Brennan married his hometown girlfriend. They had met at a bar in Edgewater; years before, Brennan played Little League baseball with her older brother. As Brennan tells it, he applied to join the C.I.A. around this time, after seeing a newspaper ad. An interviewer strapped his arm to a polygraph machine and asked if he had ever been a member of an organization that sought to overthrow the government of the United States. Brennan, not wanting to carry even the smallest deception on his conscience, said that he voted for Gus Hall, the Communist Party candidate for president, in 1976. (Decades later, Brennan volunteered the story of his Communist vote to a young woman who had asked him if participating in protests might disqualify her from working for the C.I.A. Reports of Brennan\u2019s vote reached right-wing critics of the Obama administration, who tried to use this nearly 40-year-old vote as evidence of ongoing Communist sympathies. Brennan now says that it was cast in protest against the partisanship of the Watergate era.)\n\nAt the C.I.A., Brennan quickly distinguished himself as a \u201cdeep select,\u201d a young officer given extra visibility and fast promotions. After a tour in Saudi Arabia, he grew close to George Tenet, who was working at the National Security Council as a liaison between the C.I.A. and the Clinton White House, where Brennan sometimes delivered the president\u2019s daily brief. Tenet became Clinton\u2019s third C.I.A. director in 1997, and George W. Bush kept him on. Tenet had repeatedly tried to warn Bush\u2019s team about the growing Qaeda threat, but not everyone shared his sense of urgency. Tenet and Bush took their failure to stop the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, personally. Waves of guilt and panic poured down through the C.I.A.\u2019s hierarchy as rumors spread that there might be a second wave of attacks. \u201cI remember going into the counterterrorism center,\u201d says Jami Miscik, who led the C.I.A. Directorate of Intelligence at the time. \u201cThe analysts had their children sleeping on the floor. It was such an intense effort.\u201d"

Ms. Wang embraced her so-called flaws: In one video, she was shown jokingly grabbing her stomach in front of a more slender friend, who later offered her a slice of pizza. And she displayed a self-confidence that drew comparisons to American pop stars like Beyonc\u00e9: A rap she performed included the English lyrics \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put a ring on me, I can buy my own (bling bling).\u201d"

As far as I knew that could have been the end of it, the validation.\n\nTurns out it was just the beginning. People passed me notes on airplanes thanking me. Men and women. I actually just reread three notes that I kept on my bedside table.

America Votes, a group with a permanent staff in more than 20 states that turns out voters on Election Day and rallies them around causes like reproductive rights and the environment, received more than one-fifth of its nearly $10 million budget from the four biggest public-sector unions in 2016.\n\nThe major public-sector unions are also major backers of ballot-measure campaigns, having spent more than $7 million on such efforts in 2015 and 2016. Some of the measures involved increasing taxes to fund services like education and health care, and raising the minimum wage. Unions funded opposition to a measure allowing an expansion of charter schools in Massachusetts.\n\n(Some unions said it was too early to know what spending they would cut. The American Federation of Teachers was adamant that it would continue funding certain groups, like America Votes.)\n\nIn some arenas, the loss of union money will almost certainly be offset by other liberal donors \u2014 both the wealthy and ordinary citizens. Few party operatives worry, for example, that the Democrats will lack resources for their next presidential nominee, or candidates in high-profile Senate and House races.\n\nA newly formed political action committee called End Citizens United, named for the Supreme Court decision that opened the door to more corporate money in elections, raised about $25 million, largely from small donors, during the 2016 campaign, and is on pace to exceed that amount this election cycle. Most of its spending supports House and Senate Democratic candidates favoring campaign-finance reform.\n\nIn other cases, the loss of union money may be offset by grass-roots activism.\n\nIn 2016, the four major public-sector unions gave nearly 15 percent of the $17 million raised by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which funds state legislative races nationwide. But the group is optimistic that any loss of union revenue can be offset by what it calls the \u201cpeople power\u201d of union members and other voters."

Bones, the police chief in Boise, Idaho, said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nMr. Kinner began attacking the children with a knife, said Chief Bones, who was visibly emotional as he described a scene of victims scattered across the apartment complex, in the street and on the walkway.\n\nAmong the victims, he said, were the 3-year-old who was celebrating her birthday, two 4-year-olds, a 6-year-old, an 8-year-old and a 12-year-old. The three other victims were adults who tried to intervene. Four victims received life-threatening injuries."

			"text": "Makkai, the author of two previous novels and a story collection, is good at differentiating her characters, sometimes with only a couple of spot-on details. She\u2019s particularly impressive in the mid-80s sections, where \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 it would be all too easy for a writer to portray a group of young, prosperous, party-prone gay men as essentially the same person, in different (well, really, not all that different) bodies.\n\nImage\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure, as well, when a narrative opens up worlds not familiar to most readers, when it offers actual information along with the momentum of its story and its characters. \u201cThe Great Believers,\u201d especially in the \u201980s sections, revolves around an attempt by Yale and his boss to acquire a trove of drawings by great artists of the early 20th century. Makkai turns the question of authentification \u2014 are the drawings real or clever forgeries? \u2014 into a cliffhanger and raises provocative questions about value. A sketch by Modigliani is a treasure, but the same sketch, if it merely looks like a Modigliani, is worthless.\n\nThe only lapse in \u201cThe Great Believers\u201d is the way Fiona\u2019s search for her daughter, while compelling in and of itself, is somewhat diminished by the parallel story set several decades earlier. One sees what Makkai is doing. Her method descends from Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace\u201d (yes, a grand comparison), in which Napoleon\u2019s advance on Moscow alternates with the more intimate stories of Russians struggling to live their lives. Tolstoy understood, perhaps better than any other writer, that history-altering events not only coincide with private events that alter individual lives but that if a narrative excludes either in favor of the other, it\u2019s only a partial account of our vast, infinitely complicated world.\n\nMakkai\u2019s own attempt is entirely admirable. Both halves of her narrative are about senseless loss and the efforts to survive and, if possible, redress that loss. Both are about love\u2019s power and love\u2019s limitations. Their juxtaposition reminds us that even an epidemic of unfathomable proportions doesn\u2019t banish a desperate mother and her vanished child from the sphere of our attention.\n\nNor are the two stories unrelated in their literal events. Fiona and Claire\u2019s shattered relationship is, in its way, another casualty of the epidemic, in that the illnesses and deaths of so many of Fiona\u2019s friends more or less exhausted her capacity for love. It\u2019s right to be reminded that a disease like AIDS can have such devastating, far-reaching consequences; that it can kill our loves as surely as it kills our bodies; and that its ravages extend far beyond those who are infected with the virus. And yet, in the final analysis, a mother\u2019s search for her vanished daughter can\u2019t really stand beside a scourge that has thus far cut down roughly 35 million people, and isn\u2019t finished yet.\n\nAlthough I can\u2019t help wishing the two stories had worked together more potently, that doesn\u2019t detract from the deep emotional impact of \u201cThe Great Believers,\u201d nor does it diminish Makkai\u2019s accomplishment. She has borne unblinking witness to history and to a horrific episode already in danger \u2014 among Americans, that is \u2014 of becoming a horror story out of the past, although more than a million people in this country are still infected with H.I.V.\n\nI hope that won\u2019t make Makkai\u2019s novel sound like obligatory reading for concerned citizens. In fact, it\u2019s an antidote to our general urge to forget what we\u2019d rather not remember, but it\u2019s also \u2014 which is more important \u2014 an absorbing and emotionally riveting story about what it\u2019s like to live during times of crisis. And who among us believes that, at any point in the near future, we\u2019ll cease living in times of crisis, whatever form they may take?"

Overcoming one\u2019s fears is serious business and, while I am not an expert, I believe wholeheartedly in a quotation that has been attributed to the poet Robert Frost: \u201cThe only way out is through.\u201d In other words, to get out of or resolve a painful situation, you have to confront the pain, while taking steps to alleviate it.\n\nWhat that means in crossword puzzle talk is that you get nowhere by avoiding what you perceive to be a difficult puzzle. You will get better at solving if you can forgive yourself for not knowing something, or not being able to parse a tricky clue and just keep going.\n\nNot knowing an answer isn\u2019t a failure. It\u2019s not a reflection on who you are. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a fine person. And not being able to complete a puzzle doesn\u2019t mean you failed. It just means you got as far as you could with your current level of skill. Next time, you\u2019ll do even better, especially if you work your way through our \u201cHow to Solve\u201d guide.\n\nOh, I almost forgot: No matter how hard the puzzle is, there will also always be a way in. The editors make sure of that. It will differ for everyone, because everyone knows different things. In David Steinberg\u2019s 15x16 puzzle, there\u2019s a lot of white space, and that can be intimidating. But find those gimmes first, and cheer for yourself when you fill them in. Look at you, solving a Friday New York Times crossword puzzle!"

The idea is to find ways of accelerating production without spending capital on new machinery. In the future, rather than adding more machines to increase output, \u201cwe can just dial up our equipment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe willingness to experiment with the production process even as cars are rolling off the line is perhaps the most significant way Tesla is defying the industry\u2019s conventional wisdom. Automakers like Toyota, Honda and G.M. engineer manufacturing lines that can churn out cars or trucks at a rate of about one a minute, and essentially lock in the basic assembly process once they start production. While they make tweaks to improve quality or worker safety, they generally make major changes or introduce new techniques only every few years, when an old model is phased out and before production of a new one begins.\n\n\u201cThe first step in auto quality is stability,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cOnce you get a stable process that works, you can go back and make improvements.\u201d\n\nTesla, by contrast, is tinkering with its production lines on the fly, and the tent is a stark illustration of that approach."

Misogyny has been on the rise, partly in reaction to women\u2019s more forceful demands for gender equality. The powerful Evangelical lobby and its political allies spread Islamophobia by claiming that \u201cwe, too, might become a Muslim state.\u201d The same Christian alliance has also been active in the persecution of South Korea\u2019s fledgling L.G.B.T. community, which had never been widely embraced to begin with.\n\nIt would only be right for the Moon administration to take the moral high ground and put an end to this nonsense, but there is little reason for hope. Mr. Moon, who once worked as a human rights lawyer, didn\u2019t hesitate to say that he opposed homosexuality during a televised presidential debate a year ago, showing a lack of sympathy for minorities.\n\nIf the government truly believed in fighting bigotry, it would have long since pushed to pass the comprehensive anti-discrimination act that has been stalled in the National Assembly since 2007, but no such initiative is on the horizon.\n\nJeju is a visa-free zone for tourists from most countries. When pressed on the issue of Yemeni refugees, a presidential spokesperson told journalists on June 20 that Yemen has been added to the list of countries whose citizens cannot enter without a visa. On June 29, the Justice Ministry announced that it was deploying more personnel to expedite the processing of Yemeni asylum seekers, presumably to expel them sooner.

And on June 4 \u2014 six days before the Tony Awards air on television \u2014 she will be the first journalist recognized with a Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theater.\n\nHere, annotated with comments from Ms. Krulwich, are a few of the thousands of photos she has taken, chosen to illustrate the demands of her job and the changing technology she has used to do her work."

John Bel Edwards of Louisiana signed into law an anti-hazing bill that would make it a felony for those involved in hazing that resulted in death, serious bodily harm, or life-threatening levels of alcohol.

During an interview for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, in between a conversation about Disneyland and sports cars, he was asked if he had ever experienced racism. \u201cNever. Not in the field, nor outside of it,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m black, you know?\u201d\n\nHis answer was heard like a record-scratch across the country. Was this young man in denial about his racial identity? Particularly when in the same interview he outlined his meticulous hair care regime, which involved getting his locks chemically straightened every few weeks, then bleached blonde.\n\nOr was there a less alarming explanation behind his comment? Could Neymar merely be pointing out that, as the son of a black father and a white mother, his lighter skin tone shielded him from the racist abuse directed at other players? Had he, at least in his context, reached whiteness? Whatever the interpretation, Neymar\u2019s words revealed the tricky, often contradictory ways that many Brazilians talk, and fail to talk, about race in a country with the largest population of black descendants outside of Africa."

It hopes to ditch all its diesel vehicles by the end of the year and replace them with 80 fully electric versions.\n\nReducing pollutants is a high priority for Antelope Valley, which includes the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster, because the area has the highest rate of asthma and deaths from respiratory diseases in the county, according to the county health department . \u201cThis switch-over makes sense for the environment,\u201d said Len Engel, the transit authority\u2019s executive director.\n\nImage Len Engel, the authority's executive director, said he expected to save $1 million per year in fuel costs alone.

Electric motors offer the low-speed torque such vehicles need, without the roar or exhaust of their diesel counterparts. And while range anxiety could be a concern for the typical car buyer, operators of buses and similar vehicles tend to stay close to home, needing a range of 100 miles or less."

With his signature patriotic jumpsuit and increasingly ambitious motorcycle jumps over buses, cars and sharks, the stuntman became one of the defining figures of the 1970s, simultaneously thrilling and putting the fear of death into sold-out audiences \u2014 in this case, the death they were afraid of was his.\n\nTo be fair, he didn\u2019t always crash. But he was as famous for his fails \u2014 like the New Years Eve jump over the Caesar\u2019s Palace fountain in Las Vegas in 1967 \u2014 as his successes, such as his 1971 jump over 18 Dodge Colts and a van at the Ontario Motor Speedway. The stunts, many of them presented on ABC\u2019s \u201cWide World of Sports,\u201d made him famous \u2014 spawning films, late night talk show appearances and merchandise for his burgeoning fan base. This success foreshadowed the multibillion dollar extreme sports industry.\n\nNow one of that world\u2019s biggest stars is paying tribute to the man, born Robert Craig Knievel, in a special for the History channel. On July 8, the motor sports competitor Travis Pastrana will attempt to recreate three of Knievel\u2019s jumps on live television as part of \u201cEvel Live\u201d: Caesar\u2019s Palace; a failed attempt to clear 13 double-decker buses at Wembley Stadium in London; and a successful jump over 50 stacked cars at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

You\u2019re allowed to put more than one letter or word in a square? Yes. Yes, you are. But only when the puzzle calls for it. You can\u2019t just do it randomly. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be warned when a rebus exists in the puzzle? No, that\u2019s part of the fun of solving. If more than one rebus exists in a square \u2014 and why do you do this to us? \u2014 is there a way to predict the order in which the rebus elements are supposed to be entered? Yes, there is. The Across entry is entered first, and then the Down entry. We give examples below. How am I supposed to put more than one letter or word in a square if I am solving online or on my device? Keep reading. We explain that in the last section.\n\nWhat is a Rebus?\n\nA rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square.\n\nYou\u2019ll find two kinds of letter-based rebus elements in a crossword.\n\nThe first is where the rebus entry reads the same for both the intersecting Across and Down entries, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element."

Still, there is something comfortable about this production, starring Angelina Fiordellisi and Michael O\u2019Keefe, that makes it feel in tune with the needs of the present. Its smattering of surreal musical moments, meanwhile, makes it feel like classic Mee.\n\nThe play perceives the wider world as a place of dreamscape beauty (the Magritte-style set, by Edward Pierce, contributes to that) but also of hostility and danger. And while Edith and Harold\u2019s relationship is volatile \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re like a baby with a switchblade,\u201d she tells him, with cause \u2014 the little island of the two of them often feels like a refuge, albeit a fragile one.\n\nMr. Mee has written at least a dozen plays that he classifies as love stories, and \u201cFirst Love\u201d is one of the best known. But he is a sucker for romance, and in plays like \u201cBig Love\u201d and \u201cTrue Love,\u201d swooning passion is more often what he\u2019s talking about: a feeling that doesn\u2019t have much hope of lasting. \u201cFirst Love\u201d goes deeper \u2014 to the bottom-of-the-soul ugliness of lovers\u2019 worst selves, shown to each other in moments of rage, but also to the tender comfort of simple companionship and the elemental need for affection.\n\n\u201cLove is the glue of human society,\u201d Harold says. \u201cWe can\u2019t live without it.\u201d\n\nGood thing he shoved up, then, and agreed to share the bench."

Still, many power through, gradually becoming too tired to perform their jobs well or safely. Untreated train, bus and truck drivers clearly pose a significant public safety risk.\n\nDefinitively diagnosing the condition requires a sleep test \u2014 either at home, or more extensively in a lab. Getting wired up for bed isn\u2019t much fun, which is another reason people may avoid seeking a diagnosis. Professional drivers and train operators also may worry that doing so could threaten their livelihood. To dodge screens for the condition, they may underreport feeling drowsy.\n\nThere may also be fear of sleep apnea treatments. The gold standard for treatment is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, which forces the airway open with pressure delivered through a mask. The prospect of sleeping with a mask, and next to a machine, can be off-putting and, for some, uncomfortable. Compliance with treatment is about 60 percent. But the devices have become far more comfortable and quiet over the years. (The newest models are entirely silent.)\n\nFor obese patients, losing weight can reverse sleep apnea. But keeping the weight off is notoriously hard.\n\nOther options include oral appliances (think of them as fancy mouth guards), nasal patches and, for extreme cases, surgery. Costs for devices can range from hundreds of dollars to thousands. Even at the high end, you may feel a considerable boost in quality of life that could be worth the cost.\n\nAlthough these options work for snoring, too, insurance won\u2019t cover them for that condition. Similar over-the-counter oral appliances are cheaper, but less extensively studied, making it hard to say for whom they will work well. Studies document that patients use over-the-counter versions less, perhaps because they may be less comfortable than professionally customized ones. So, although snoring is highly curable, the cost and uncertainty of exactly how to do so may be a barrier for many to treat it.\n\nThere\u2019s a public safety interest in treating sleep apnea more widely. Yet last summer, in an effort to reduce regulations, the Trump administration withdrew a proposed rule that would have required drivers of trucks and buses, as well as railroad engineers, to be tested for the condition. This may be one area where a little more regulation is warranted."

Yet the records shed light on how the group managed to hold onto so much land in the first place. And with ISIS still in control of approximately 1,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, they may also offer lessons about the battles ahead.\n\nThe records are contained in hundreds of files recovered from a cluster of buildings in the northern Iraqi town of Tel Kaif, which had housed the group\u2019s Shorta Islamiya \u2014 its Islamic police force. Most of the papers were discovered by Iraqi security forces who liberated the area in early 2017. They in turn handed them over to The New York Times, so that their contents could be shared with the world.\n\nGrocers, convenience store owners and traders who sold their goods on credit turned to the Islamic State government when customers failed to pay. They sought reimbursement for a cow, a bird, meat, wheat, vegetables, an oil change and a heater. One filed a report for the 150 meters of electrical wire he hadn\u2019t been compensated for.\n\nFarmers asked for investigations into the crops damaged by livestock. One sought compensation for the watermelons trampled by an errant sheep. Another said his newly planted field had been kicked up by a total of 21 cows. Yet another reported a shepherd who, he said, allowed his flock to graze on his land seven different times. \u201cEach time, I forgive him and he says he won\u2019t do it again, and then he does,\u201d he lamented in the report.\n\nThe records in the ornate folder below detail the case of 30 stolen sheep."

Like an apparition, an unlikely pair of women \u2014 Anahit Hayrapetyan, an Armenian Christian, and Serra Akcan, a Muslim from Turkey, traveled through the region without men but with cameras, dredging up uncomfortable century-old secrets.\n\nThe women were searching for \u201chidden Armenians,\u201d whose Christian ancestors survived what historians consider to be a genocide by the Ottoman Empire, starting in 1915, in which nearly 1.5 million Armenians died. The Turkish government rejects the term genocide.\n\nThese hidden Armenians whom the photographers sought are descendants of survivors, who were mostly women and children taken in by local Kurdish, Turkish and Arab families, and converted to Islam. In some of the more remote villages in Turkey that Ms. Hayrapetyan and Ms. Akcan visited, the ethnic and religious background of these Armenians were concealed out of fear of reprisal from their neighbors. Parents rarely informed children of their Armenian heritage, with many even avoiding the spoken language so children would not pick it up and discover their ancestry."

			"text": "Where do you currently reside?\n\nBrooklyn, N.Y.\n\nWhere and when was your first puzzle published?\n\nJune 6, 2014, in The New York Times.\n\nHow did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?\n\nMy mom is really into crosswords, so they were always sort of around. Whenever we went on long car trips (which was often), my mom would bring her puzzle books. I always found them a little stuffy, to be honest. My first solving memory is of completing an Elizabeth Gorski Sunday puzzle in The New York Times \u2014 I forget which one. But it was very exciting for teenage me, to feel like a puzzle was speaking my language, and also to learn that I could finish one \u2014 a Sunday, no less. As for how I got into constructing \u2026 Honestly, it was a mix of being sleepless, coming across the right puzzles by people whose taste and style I found motivating (Brendan Emmett Quigley, Liz Gorski, Natan Last, Ian Livengood, Pete Wentz, Paula Gamache, Joe Krozel, many others), and being in the market for a new hobby. It wasn\u2019t really something I ever set out to do, to be honest, but I have just enough of an obsessive, perfectionist streak to be an easy mark. What always impressed me most were the puzzles whose vocabulary was wide-ranging, learned, witty, modern and resourceful, and that\u2019s still what I prioritize most as a constructor.\n\nWhy do you do this to yourself?\n\nHa! I complain about constructing a lot \u2014 it\u2019s an activity that can be full of disappointment, as plenty of puzzles just don\u2019t work out, and that\u2019s a genuine pain \u2014 but in truth, I mostly find it relaxing. I go into a zone when I construct. Unless I\u2019m on a deadline, it\u2019s truly my comedown activity when I\u2019m not busy with work and feel like creating something.\n\nDo you use a computer software constructing program and, if so, which one? What do you like about it?\n\nI\u2019m a huge advocate of software. I use Crossfire. I guess I can see the nobility in constructing by hand; that\u2019s where a lot of us (including myself) started, and it\u2019s an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of grid design, strategic letter patterns and so on. But I\u2019m primarily a themeless constructor, and at the end of the day, those puzzles are impossible to sell unless they\u2019re very clean and very juicy. That\u2019s hard to do without a constantly updated word list at your disposal, to say nothing of software that helps you to be realistic about whether the puzzle will actually work.\n\nHow many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?\n\nAdding to my word list is such a constant activity that I can\u2019t really even calculate it in terms of hours. On my phone, I have a Google Doc with a list that I add words to multiple times a day. I add that list en masse to my proper word list about once a month. For the month of January, for example, my Google list currently has about 500 new entries, all things I came across while reading the news, watching movies, talking to people or even just sitting around and minding my business. Five hundred seems like a lot, but not really when you consider the multiple verb tenses of some entries (GIVE A BACKRUB, GIVES A BACKRUB, GAVE A BACKRUB) and the fact that some proper names are worth two to three entries (MARCELLA HAZAN, as opposed to MARCELLA and HAZAN). I also add words all the time while constructing. This is probably the most important part of constructing. Relatedly, I keep a separate list of \u201cseed entries\u201d \u2014 words I\u2019m eager to build an entire puzzle around \u2014 that\u2019s organized by word length, and alphabetized therein. I also keep a list called \u201c[Expletive, rhymes with \u2018Witty\u2019] Word List,\u201d which is for entries that I am personally disinclined to use in a themeless (partials, prefixes, suffixes, most abbreviations) but which come in handy for themed puzzles, where the rules on these things are a little looser. I upload that word list to Crossfire whenever my slimmed-down word list is making it impossible to fill a themed puzzle adequately. One important point: I subtract words all the time, and while some that get removed from my main word list end up in the \u201c[Witty] Word List\u201d because they\u2019re technically fair game and may come in handy, most simply get deleted. This happens while I\u2019m constructing, and it\u2019s another constant process. If I know I\u2019ll never use a word, I\u2019m quick to dismiss it; it makes the constructing process easier, because I don\u2019t keep getting bombarded with options that I\u2019d never accept (or that editors would never accept). Crossfire and other software only know the words you feed them, so rather than giving these undesirable words a low word score (which tells the program to emphasize them less), I remove them entirely. I would say that I delete 50-60 words from my word list per three-hour constructing session, all with an eye toward being able to focus on the options that appeal to me more.\n\nWhat entry or entries would you never put in a puzzle, and why? Or, with what entry would you deliberately fail the \u201cbreakfast test,\u201d and why?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve already told you how I feel about the -ASE\u2019s and WHAT A\u2019s and long or ugly abbreviations (a four-letter abbreviation would have to be as common as HTTP for me to feel comfortable using it, and plural abbreviations are generally extremely inelegant to me unless they\u2019re three letters at most and extremely common). But there\u2019s also cultural stuff. I\u2019ve removed most gun references from my word list \u2014 I don\u2019t know that I care so much about other people using them, as they\u2019re a part of everyday life (and for reasons that aren\u2019t strictly fatal). But I\u2019m not that into them and didn\u2019t feel like debating with myself over them every time they came up. Most urgently, the thought of inadvertently publishing a gun reference in the midst of national mourning over a fresh tragedy is pretty mortifying to me. You can\u2019t control that kind of thing. I\u2019m careful about things like casual misogyny in puzzles and always have been \u2014 those entries tend to be dated in a bad way, as bloggers remind us every time one rears its head. I\u2019ve also, relatedly, been thinking a lot about #MeToo and the public figures I\u2019m now disinclined to put in my puzzles \u2014 this is the sort of thing a constructor thinks about, or should, as the premise of the breakfast test is to avoid unnecessary unpleasantness, and a smart constructor constantly wrestles with what that means. As for pushing boundaries, I prefer surprising people in other ways: realms of culture they didn\u2019t expect to see, or very modern slang. Testing the limits of the \u201cbreakfast test\u201d often just means spicing things up with sex or drug references, or being mildly profane in some way, but I actually find that stuff pretty boring, like cursing on the playground for the first time. It\u2019s just not that shocking \u2014 it\u2019s harder to be creative in other ways. The funniest part of all this is that no matter how careful you think you\u2019re being about your word list, someone solving (or reviewing!) your puzzle might still disagree with what constitutes good vs. bad fill. I love these disagreements over language, even as the complaints can be frustrating. I recently published a puzzle with the word ACTE in it, and it was listed by a blogger as one of the bad entries, which would never occur to me. It\u2019s a basic French word, has a healthy life in crosswords, and \u2014 most important, in my book \u2014 is a cognate, which makes it super gettable. But I can\u2019t begrudge people not loving that particular word; it\u2019s completely a matter of taste. When people complain about the all the nonwhite people I put in my puzzles, on the other hand, my feathers get ruffled.\n\nAnything else we should know?\n\nPlease subscribe to the American Values Crossword!\n\nAfter this interview took place, Mr. Collins announced his involvement with The New Yorker crosswords.

I also thought that it transcended the genre a bit by requiring some knowledge other than just a facility with language, which made it very fun.\n\nFor example, at 7D, \u201cOne international organization in possession of Roma robot,\u201d the run-of-the-mill approach would be to assume that the letters R-O-M-A appear somewhere internally in the entry, since the words \u201cin possession of\u201d refer to that word (and \u201cOne international organization\u201d would define the outer portion of the entry). The answer, though, is AUTOMATON, which means \u201crobot.\u201d The definition fits the cryptic rules, and A UN stands for \u201cOne (A) international organization (U.N., or United Nations).\u201d But whither \u201croma?\u201d Well, \u201cRoma\u201d is a paste tomato variety that is used to make sauce \u2014 you\u2019ve probably opened a can of Romas once or twice in your life. So the internal word that I\u2019d expect to be \u201croma\u201d is TOMATO.\n\nAnother case of this appears at 4A, \u201cJazzy guy, pocketing 200 milligrams of diamonds from the East, falls.\u201d It\u2019s probably safe to assume that a puzzle solver recognizes a \u201cjazzy guy\u201d as a CAT. We might also assume 200 would appear as CC, though, and milligrams as MGS, and both of those are misses in this case. In actuality, we\u2019re looking for 200 milligrams of diamonds, since no word in a cryptic puzzle is wasted. 200 milligrams of diamonds? That\u2019s a CARAT. Next, we see that the CARAT is coming \u201cfrom the East\u201d \u2014 i.e., heading west, or reading from right to left. Take CAT, insert TARAC, you get a CATARACT, which defines waterfalls as well as an eye ailment. The two definitions are related: A cataract in one\u2019s eye resembles the opaque white of a white-water rapid flowing down a rock face."

But instead of announcing plans to appeal the ruling Friday, the state\u2019s top health official said he would work with the Trump administration to \u201cquickly resolve the single issue raised by the court so that we can move forward.\u201d The official, Adam Meier, added that if the new rules could not be quickly implemented, \u201cwe will have no choice but to make significant benefit reductions.\u201d\n\nSeema Verma, chosen by President Trump to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the decision \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said she would confer with the Justice Department \u201cto chart a path forward.\u201d\n\nThe debate over requiring poor people to work to keep their health insurance encapsulates fundamentally different visions of the role of Medicaid, a program jointly funded by federal and state governments that now covers one in five Americans. Many Republicans see it as a welfare program that should be conditioned on participants working if they are able, while Democrats consider it a crucial element of the government safety net for the poor.\n\nRequiring Medicaid recipients to work \u2014 and to pay monthly premiums, which was also part of Kentucky\u2019s plan \u2014 would have significantly reduced the number of people with coverage, many experts predicted. People could lose their health benefits if they were deemed able to work or volunteer but did not, or were unable to keep up with premium payments or provide the documentation every month to prove they had worked the required 80 hours.\n\nMr. Bevin, a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act, took office after his Democratic predecessor enthusiastically expanded Medicaid under the law. He has argued that the program was created for only the most vulnerable citizens \u2014 those who aren\u2019t merely poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or younger than 21. Mr. Bevin and a growing number of mostly Republican governors believe that adults with no disabilities, millions of whom became eligible for Medicaid under the health law, should work or otherwise engage in their community to keep their coverage."

We were looking for a fair system that encouraged attacking soccer. But we also considered a few constraints \u2014 of what FIFA could realistically accept. Ideally, the length of the tournament would be roughly the same, and the number of games would not surpass 100. (The current World Cup has 64 games in 32 days, and the 2026 Cup is set to have 80 games.)\n\nMany readers proposed a format of eight groups of six teams, but that would mean 120 games in the group phase alone and add at least two weeks to the tournament (assuming four group games per day and at least a Round of 16). Those proposals didn\u2019t make our cut, but here are some that did, with commentary on their feasibility from Mr. Guyon. Some reader responses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOnly One Team Advances in Each Group of 3\n\nIt seems the problem is two teams per group advancing. Limit it to one team. Then you have 16 groups of three yielding a field of 16 teams that can proceed in straight elimination. In this case your issue would be meaningless final group matches with teams that have both lost (to Team A in your analysis).\n\n\u2014 Pete, NY\n\nJulien responds: This would indeed eliminate the risk of collusion but has several serious pitfalls. In three-team groups, let\u2019s call Team A the team that plays the first two games, and Team B and Team C the two other teams. First, as this reader notices, the last group match may be a dead rubber (when Team A has two wins). Second, there is still a fairness issue. When Team A has one win and one draw (say, against B and C, respectively), Team B is already eliminated before the last group match and may not give its best effort to defeat C. If C wins the group after beating an unmotivated Team B, Team A may feel aggrieved. Third, this example shows that in this format a team (B in this case) can be eliminated after playing just one game. Finally, this format would have a total of 64 matches, just as in this year\u2019s Cup, but FIFA seems to want to increase that number. And the winner would play only six matches, one less than today."

			"text": "Though Piper remembers her students fondly, her decade and a half at Wellesley presents one of the most unusual focal points in any autobiographical writing I have ever read. In 2000, she brought suit against both Wellesley and its president at the time, Diana Chapman Walsh, for breach of contract and other claims, arguing, according to court documents, that the college had been \u201cunjustly enriched by reaping the benefit of free publicity from her anti-racist artwork while failing to provide her with promised institutional support.\u201d The lawsuit and a subsequent complaint were dismissed, but Piper\u2019s relationship with the school, where she remained employed until 2008, never recovered.\n\nIn \u201cEscape to Berlin,\u201d Piper\u2019s need to flee Wellesley takes on the urgency and melodrama of a psychological thriller. In several instances she accuses members of the philosophy department, the administration and the board of campaigns of harassment, vandalism and, ultimately, trying to kill her. (She never explicitly mentions Wellesley, referring only to \u201cThe College.\u201d) \u201cI still think The College wants me dead,\u201d she writes, \u201cthat it will want this even more once this memoir is published; and that, with its powerful international political and corporate connections, it will find a way to make this happen.\u201d She made an artwork that consists of the words \u201cMake it look like an accident\u201d over a smiling, desaturated self-portrait, specifically over the area of forehead where a hired assassin would aim a laser beam.\n\nIf you talk to faculty members who knew Piper at Wellesley or to members of the current administration, you will receive a range of reactions to this claim. \u201cI think people were inclined always to be helpful to her and maybe even a bit protective of her at first,\u201d Alison McIntyre, a chairwoman of the philosophy department at that time, told me in an email. \u201cNothing about her persecution narrative seemed to us to be grounded in reality, but still, I think the attitude toward her was more like uncomprehending forbearance, not hostility.\u201d When I asked Wellesley to comment, a spokeswoman provided a statement that called Piper an \u201cexceptional conceptual artist\u201d who eventually came to have \u201cher differences with the College, but all of her claims against Wellesley were dismissed in court.\u201d Wellesley explained her termination as a direct consequence of her absence: After moving to Germany, she didn\u2019t show up to work for more than two years.\n\nYet when I spoke to Selwyn R. Cudjoe, a professor of Africana Studies who was instrumental in recruiting Piper to the school, he offered another layer of complexity. \u201cAdrian is a brilliant woman,\u201d he said. \u201cA brilliant, black woman. Folks in philosophy may have been very, not resentful, but they do not accept excellence among black people that easily.\u201d Cudjoe is the longest-serving black faculty member at Wellesley. He assured me that, in his 32 years there, he found Wellesley to be \u201ca very nurturing place.\u201d But something about our conversation about whatever happened to Piper must have touched him. Several days after we spoke on the phone, he emailed me again: \u201cSince talking with you, I have been thinking. I believe that part of Wellesley\u2019s problem \u2014 and Adrian may have been a victim of this \u2014 is that it does not quite know how to treat its older black intellectuals, particularly if they are as smart as Adrian is. It might be that we have been here for such a short time they don\u2019t quite know whether to appreciate our talent and our gifts or that we do not demonstrate enough thanks or gratefulness for their having hired us to this prestigious institution.\u201d\n\nWhatever one is prepared to accept as plausible, it seems undeniable that Piper derives from the particularities of her own experiences at elite institutions like Harvard and Wellesley certain larger questions about the very real challenges of being a black woman or of simply being black or being a woman, that are worth taking very seriously indeed. Still, the allegations about Wellesley nagged at me. While I don\u2019t doubt for an instant that Piper came to seem extravagantly inconvenient to a number of people there or that she believes in the core of her being that her life really was at stake, I could not square the extremity of her feelings of persecution with my own sense of reality, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nWhen I happened to be back in Berlin a couple of weeks after we first met, I saw Piper again for lunch, and we continued to email each other after I had left. At some point, I mentioned that \u201cPassing for White, Passing for Black\u201d was a better piece of writing than almost all of the first-person essays on race that I am familiar with, and that I would be grappling with it for years. What was so special and convincing in it, I felt, was the extent to which it exposed the fatal flaws and limitations inherent in both black and white points of view \u2014 how she could occupy a position not of pure seeing, but of fuller seeing, much fuller than most of us will ever access. What I could not understand, then, I wrote her, was why the essay hadn\u2019t reached a significantly larger audience. She wrote back that it was supposed to have run in a major national magazine, but that she and the commissioning editor had a falling out over the content. I asked to see the exchanges, and she forwarded them to me with his name deleted.\n\nThroughout a series of long missives, the editor was both solicitous and flattering toward Piper but also bizarrely patronizing, trying to coach her through her own conclusions in a way that I had never seen before in my professional life. In frustration, after months, she pulled the piece. As I wondered whether she, and now I, might be reading something racial into an exchange where there had simply been a misunderstanding \u2014 perhaps it was because she was an academic and not a journalist \u2014 I asked her the editor\u2019s name. As soon as she told me, a flood of memories suddenly rushed back."

The film cements Mr. Brolin\u2019s unlikely rise from character actor to an anchor of three franchises, following his villain turns in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cDeadpool 2.\u201d\n\n\u201cDay of the Soldado\u201d was distributed by Sony and financed by Black Label Media for $35 million, and follows an escalating battle between Mexican cartels and the U.S. government. The decision to make a sequel to the brutal 2015 drama raised some eyebrows when first announced, especially because of the absence of Emily Blunt, one of the first film\u2019s stars. But the opening weekend of \u201cDay of the Soldado\u201d outpaced that of its predecessor, which opened wide to $12.1 million.\n\nWhile the first \u201cSicario\u201d received stronger reviews \u2014 93 percent positive on Rotten Tomatoes, compared with 62 percent for its sequel \u2014 this installment might have been boosted both by the increased visibility of its two leading men in a string of blockbusters and its timely material, as debates rage about the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d from Universal and \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d from Disney-Pixar took first and second place with $60 million and $45.5 million, respectively, and both are thriving internationally. \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d now sits at $932 million globally, while \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d has made $647 million, surpassing its predecessor\u2019s lifetime gross before even opening in major European markets like Britain, Spain and Germany."

Such a change would have made it much more difficult for localities to pay for police, fire, transit and other public services.\n\nAccording to several state senators, the industry then went to lawmakers in Sacramento with a proposal: Pass a bill banning soda and food taxes, and the industry would drop its November ballot initiative.\n\n\u201cThey sent us a ransom note that they will drop this horrible ballot measure if we put a 12-year moratorium on local soda taxes,\u201d said Mr. Wiener, who has long supported soda taxes and voted against the bill that now bars them. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of picking your poison. The soda industry has gone completely rogue.\u201d\n\nSeveral top lawmakers said they opposed the measure banning soft drink taxes, known as Senate Bill 872, b ut many felt obliged to support it because they were so worried about the effects of the broader ballot initiative.\n\nNancy Skinner, a state senator who represents Richmond, Calif., as well as three cities that passed soda taxes in 2016, voted against the measure but said she recognized that her colleagues who supported it were in a bind. The law will not overturn soda taxes enacted before 2018, but it will prevent any new ones, including a soda tax on the ballot later this year in Richmond. \u201cIt is totally wrong to deny the residents of Richmond a vote,\u201d she said.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown avoided taking a position on the bill until Thursday but has now signed it into law. Critics of the bill pointed to a photo that shows him posing with executives from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the American Beverage Association at a recent private dinner at the governor\u2019s mansion. The governor\u2019s spokesman said the meeting was unrelated to the soda tax measure .\n\nThe push for the pre-emption law began to materialize this year when an industry-financed group, the California Business Roundtable, started collecting signatures for the ballot initiative making local tax increases harder. The American Beverage Association California PAC contributed heavily to the effort, raising $6 million from Coke and Pepsi, $1 million from Dr Pepper Snapple and $100,000 from Red Bull."

Just as a Catholic priest at a wealthy parish would be accustomed to overlooking his parishioners\u2019 discreet reliance on contraception (a respectable practice his Church condemns as immoral), these religious leaders were used to saying that people with messy lives now could make good.\n\nCompare members of Mr. Trump\u2019s Evangelical Advisory Board to attendees at a recent conference of Trump skeptics at Wheaton College, the elite Evangelical institution. Mr. Trump\u2019s board is overwhelmingly drawn from the Southern Baptist Convention and various Pentecostal and prosperity gospel churches. Figures at the Wheaton conference were more likely to be from Presbyterian churches, or conservative offshoots of the Episcopal Church.\n\nThese denominational differences reflect a class divide. About 35 percent of Episcopalians and 25 percent of Presbyterians have a family income above $100,000. Only 16 percent of Southern Baptists and 10 percent of the pentecostal Assemblies of God can say the same. An Episcopalian is more likely to have an advanced degree than a Southern Baptist is to have a college diploma.\n\nBaffling as it may be to elites, Mr. Trump embodies a real if imperfect model of family values. People familiar with the purple family model tend to view his alienation from his children\u2019s mother as normal and his closeness to his children as exceptional and admirable. I saw this among my acquaintances in Nebraska. Even those from red families were more likely than my acquaintances in New York to know someone who has had a child out of wedlock or is subject to a restraining order.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s purple family values may even explain some of his populist appeal. Global leaders like Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker appear to have stable and loving marriages. But their childlessness makes them worse exemplars of family values in the eyes of some non-elites than divorcees who have multiple children \u2014 a category that includes Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s far-right League party, and Marine Le Pen, of France\u2019s National Rally party, as well as Donald Trump. Contempt for elite respectability is reflected not only in the respective party platforms, but in the personal lives of these populist leaders.\n\nIn her speech to the 1992 Republican Convention, Barbara Bush said, \u201cHowever you define family, that\u2019s what we mean by family values.\u201d Debates over Mr. Trump show that different ideas of family are not so easily reconciled."

Like Ondaatje, Barrodale makes me hold my head and ask, \u201cHow?\u201d\n\nWhat kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days?\n\nI\u2019ve been reading for research about Victorian America, all while imagining the next historical novel I want to write. It\u2019s fun to time travel, and the books I\u2019ve been reading widen my perspective on what\u2019s going on right now. My novel will be partially set in San Francisco, and reading about all the technological developments that took place at the dawn of the 20th century, I can\u2019t help drawing parallels between now and then, as Silicon Valley is the hub for so much tech development. Victorian technology caused a major cultural shift and brought the middle class to the fore through media, manufacturing, capitalist marketing, entertainment. I really wonder what will happen next. The internet bubble is bigger than the planet now. Will it pop? Will people stop existing IRL? One day, you\u2019ll buy a soul online with Bitcoin and live in SimCity, a virtual life. Maybe that\u2019s already happened. Isn\u2019t that what Elon Musk has argued \u2014 that we are living in a video game?\n\nAny genres you avoid?\n\nI can\u2019t read self-help books. Please, everybody, stop sending them to me!\n\nHow do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night?\n\nI tend to read books for research over weeks during the day, and consume novels either in a single afternoon, or a few pages once a week for years. Sometimes reading is like medicine, other times it is a confrontation with God \u2014 I don\u2019t do it much in public. I like to read physical books, mostly in bed with earplugs in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\n\n\u201cLive at the Masque: Nightmare in Punk Alley,\u201d a book of photographs and ephemera from Los Angeles in the \u201970s, when punk was punk and the young people were so creative and full of energy. So refreshing to see images of nonconformists. The Masque was a basement club where bands like X, the Weirdos and the Bags all played. Kristine McKenna, who is a dear friend and recently wrote \u201cRoom to Dream\u201d with David Lynch, wrote a stunning foreword."

Many of the thriving areas are places where these technologically advanced companies and their employees cluster.\n\nIn what is surely a related pattern, Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution found that not only are there big differences in the productivity of different regions \u2014 how much economic output is generated per worker \u2014 but that the high-productivity regions are also pulling away from the low-productivity ones.\n\nThis body of work \u2014 focused on how differences in regional economies can explain broader challenges \u2014 is attracting more notice from economists and policymakers who have tended to look at things from a national perspective. They\u2019re realizing it may not be enough to worry about overall levels of G.D.P. or employment or wages, when those headline numbers can mask big problems.\n\n\u201cConvergence used to be the order of the day,\u201d said Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. \u201cNow if anything divergence is the order of the day. There\u2019s a lot more to understand, but at a minimum we need to start recognizing place as a legitimate construct in our thinking.\u201d\n\nMr. Summers, known for his work on macroeconomics, began arguing around the time of the 2016 election that economics researchers needed to start taking regional divides more seriously as a contributor to bigger problems. To that end, he recently wrote a paper with his Harvard colleague Edward Glaeser, a leading scholar of urban and regional economics, and Benjamin Austin that examined how the rising rate of nonemployment among prime-aged men in parts of the American heartland had fed into social dysfunctions."

As a result, activism around abortion rights has risen, and I\u2019ve watched in admiration as well-known women (from the entertainers Chelsea Handler and Vanessa Williams to Representative Jackie Speier) have spoken about their own experiences, while groups like We Testify and Shout Your Abortion, co-founded by the writer Lindy West, have collected stories online.

It was true \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the whole truth.\n\nAnd that day on Twitter, I began to feel like a coward.\n\nThis silence, after all, has a price: First, it renders the women who make this choice anonymous and lets those who would deny us our freedom do so without looking us in the eye. There are so many would-be deniers today: Iowa has passed a law that outlaws most abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy, making it virtually impossible for most women to have one; politicians and pundits \u2014 from President Trump on the campaign trail to the columnist Kevin Williamson \u2014 now like to bat around the idea of punishment for those of us who have made this choice. (\u201cI\u2019ve got a soft spot for hanging,\u201d Mr. Williamson said, chillingly.)\n\nBut would it be quite so easy to demonize this common experience if it were clear that the women who have gone through it include kindergarten teachers, clergywomen, Republicans, C.E.O.s, the woman who served your coffee this morning, who cleans your house, who signs your paycheck, who patrols your neighborhood? As the activist Renee Bracey Sherman, who runs the We Testify site, put it: \u201cEveryone loves someone who has had an abortion. And if you think you don\u2019t, they just haven\u2019t shared their story with you yet.\u201d\n\nSilence also allows menacing myths about abortion to thrive. Most Americans believe the procedure to be less common than it is, and more dangerous. No wonder: According to one study, on television 5 percent of all female characters who choose abortion die \u2014 a figure that is 7,000 times the actual, very low real-life mortality rate. As for the popular perception that women regret their abortions, 95 percent of women who end their pregnancies say they believe they made the right decision. Oh, and the stereotype that women who get abortions are selfish or unmaternal? Well, the majority already have one child, studies show. But for a young woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy, those are terrifying misperceptions to contend with.\n\nIt\u2019s time for those of us who know and have lived the truth to raise our hands and say no, this is the real story: Many of us have been here before you, and we are here for you, and we will not let your rights be rolled back. With that in mind, I recently told my own 15-year-old daughter about the choice I\u2019d made. To my surprise, I cried as I described my life that year \u2014 the confusion, my mother\u2019s illness \u2014 and though she was just a kid, not much younger than I had been then, she wiped my tears. I told her that I felt immense gratitude for the life I have been able to build, for the two children I\u2019ve been able to care and provide for, for the marriage I could choose freely, for the dreams I was able to pursue. And all of it, I told her, was made possible by my right to decide when I was ready to be a mother."

It was a late morning in June and the sun was high; there was nothing to apologize for. But she is congenitally polite and, as she stared up at the storied Art Deco observatory in Griffith Park here, on an 1,100-foot summit of Mount Hollywood, maybe a tiny bit self-conscious.\n\nThe hike had been her idea. A brisk climb punctuated by postcard views of Los Angeles landmarks: the Hollywood sign, the Santa Monica Mountains, the gauzy downtown skyline. Growing up in Colorado as one of seven children, hiking had been a family ritual \u2014 her parents\u2019 way of getting her and her siblings to burn off energy without busting through the walls or the budget.\n\nBut because of an unlikely chain of recent events that, she explained, began with a run-in with her childhood ballet teacher and ended with an overeager return to the horizontal bar, she had suffered an \u201cold lady injury.\u201d Which meant that she hadn\u2019t exercised in a while. Which meant that, even a few dozen yards into a hike with someone whom she just met, she\u2019d already felt herself running short of breath.\n\nBetween the panting and the fanny pack, Ms. Adams, already a five-time Oscar-nominated actress at 43, had begun to wonder what she must look like."

So the authorities identified the man, Jarrod Ramos, using a different method: facial recognition technology.\n\nThe revelation shone a spotlight on just how easily and how quickly officials can pinpoint suspects using a technology that is increasingly pervasive in law enforcement. Over the past few years, facial recognition has been quietly adopted by the authorities across the United States \u2014 including at the local policing level \u2014 and become part of the standard law enforcement toolkit.\n\nSixteen states let the Federal Bureau of Investigation use the technology to compare the faces of suspected criminals to driver\u2019s license and ID photos, according to a report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology. And thanks to recent improvements to facial recognition by some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, its influence in policing is likely to grow.\n\n\u201cFace recognition is one of the most important developments in crime fighting since the discovery of fingerprinting in the 19th century,\u201d said Joseph J. Atick, a pioneer in face recognition technology and executive chairman of ID4Africa, which works with African governments to institute national identification systems. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a police department in the United States with more than 10 to 15 cops in it that does not have access to face recognition.\u201d"

I am a feminist and I write about architecture, and sometimes it\u2019s really difficult, because women haven\u2019t been allowed to have prominent roles in architecture until the very recent past, and even now representation isn\u2019t as good as it should be. It wasn\u2019t hard to make my book inclusive, at least in terms of gender. Many other things I\u2019ve written, I\u2019ve had to look hard and dig. Many of these women weren\u2019t classified as architects or designers, but nowadays we would see them as creators, designers. People thought of things for children as minor. I wanted to say: This is not minor; this is major.\n\nImage Alexandra Lange Credit Mark Wickens\n\nIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\n\nI had two chapters in my proposal that I dropped. One was about technology and one was about transportation. I didn\u2019t really drop those topics, I just realized they made more sense not as stand-alones but as part of the narrative in other chapters. Technology, especially. I had been thinking of construction video games as a whole separate subject, but as I did more research, I learned that all the designers of these video games had played with Legos. Games like Minecraft are really based on what\u2019s considered common cultural knowledge of using building blocks. They\u2019re part of the longer-term narrative of the design and innovation of construction toys. To me, it was important to put those things back together, because they\u2019re always talked about in separate spaces. And there\u2019s this sense that we\u2019ll abandon the physical world for the digital world, but even the creators of these products don\u2019t want that. They understand the two are linked.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nLillian Gilbreth, a psychologist, engineer and a pioneer of what\u2019s called motion study. She and her husband, Frank Gilbreth, invented this field, which breaks down industrial processes into a series of set movements using film. They used it in the beginning of the 20th century to teach workers to do tasks more efficiently and to redesign machinery to accommodate the way people worked. \u201cCheaper by the Dozen\u201d was written by two of their children. That book really captured my imagination. I was a very design-y child, and I internalized all these lessons about trying to use the minimum number of pots to make dinner, or how to take the minimum number of steps.\n\nShe was the co-author of all these papers with her husband, and then in 1924 he died very suddenly of a heart attack, and all the companies that would hire them together wouldn\u2019t hire her as a single woman. She learned that the kind of companies that would hire her were catering to female consumers, and they assumed she would know about women. She ended up working for Macy\u2019s, and for the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company on kitchens. I love how she made lemonade out of lemons. I feel there are lots of lessons in her life for women in all kinds of industries.\n\nPersuade someone to read \u201cThe Design of Childhood\u201d in 50 words or less.\n\nChildhood is fleeting but what we play affects our lives forever. For anyone interested in child development, design or architecture, my book uncovers the thinking behind toys and children\u2019s spaces and shows how parents, teachers and planners can foster kids\u2019 independence and creativity."

Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Only his skeletal legs and lower torso protruded from beneath the 600-pound block.\n\nAt the time, the team reported that a volcanic cloud had launched a stone door jamb toward the man, decapitating him. What appeared to be the Wile E. Coyote-esque nature of the man\u2019s final moments made him an instant, meme-worthy celebrity some 2,000 years after his death.\n\nBut further digging has unearthed the man\u2019s intact skull with his mouth wide open (and full of teeth), suggesting he was not crushed by a volcanic projectile. The skull and the man\u2019s upper torso and arms were found about three feet nearly directly below the rest of the body and the gigantic stone. The team said they knew the bones belonged to the same person because of their proximity to each other and because the two halves matched up. The archaeologists from the Pompeii Archaeological Park announced their finding Thursday."

That\u2019s the interest rate banks charge one another for overnight loans. It\u2019s important because it\u2019s an economic cue ball, creating a knock-on effect for other interest rates.\n\nThe Fed forecasters\u2019 median prediction is that the federal funds rate is headed to 3.4 percent by the end of 2020 from the current 1.9 percent. This means you\u2019ll be paying more to get a mortgage, a new-car loan or to carry a balance on your credit card. How much more? Possibly enough to absorb whatever extra income you might be enjoying from lower tax rates or higher wages.\n\nThe Fed is picking our pockets because, to prevent the economy from overheating, it is legally required to keep inflation in check by raising rates. But the task has been made more urgent by the Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, which effectively threw gasoline onto a very hot barbecue.\n\n\u201cIt makes the Fed\u2019s job more difficult all around because what you\u2019re getting is a stimulus at the very wrong moment,\u201d a noted former Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said in a recent appearance at the American Enterprise Institute. Economists at the Fed would never have chosen such a policy. But in the G.O.P., tax cuts aren\u2019t so much science as they are theology, even if the faithful have to be sacrificed."

			"text": "It\u2019s for the best. Really. Really. Now he could fully turn toward the projects that had been whispering in his ear during all these months of writers\u2019 rooms and outlining and script writing. He wanted to write a story for National Geographic about seabirds. Their population is down two-thirds since 1950. \u201cSeabirds are in great trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cSeabirds are amazing, and they are in great trouble.\u201d\n\nHe had more to say about seabirds. He had more to say about every topic we discussed. But here\u2019s the thing: When he speaks, he enunciates down to the soul of every single letter. He takes this lingual habit and out of his mouth he erects complete cities \u2014 rigorously formed ones, with firehouses and railroad stations and schools and coffee joints and community centers. He makes no points that are complete at the usual magazine-article quotable size. He makes no points that can be distilled to a few words and still be understood in their breadth. The breadth is the point.\n\nOh, he said, there was also the new novel he wanted to write, which was coming along in the initial thinking-about-it phase. He had three character names picked out. \u201cEverything is subject to negotiation, but once you get a name,\u201d he grinned with his lower lip over his upper teeth, his head quivering in delight. He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.\n\nThere was also the book of essays that Susan Golomb, his agent, wanted to sell \u2014 a collection of the nonfiction he had recently published. It would take considerable time to edit them, and even do some rewriting. He\u2019d been surprised at how some of those essays were received in the world \u2014 that his Edith Wharton essay in The New Yorker that mentioned her self-consciousness about her looks could be misconstrued as sexist when she herself was so obsessed with appearances (\u201cHis depiction of Edith Wharton was so mean-spirited and off-key that I tossed and turned,\u201d Victoria Patterson wrote in The Los Angeles Review of Books), or that his New Yorker essay on threats to birds more immediate than global change \u2014 like the proliferation of glassy buildings that blindside birds in flight \u2014 had resulted in the vitriol it did. (\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what the Audubon Society did to piss off Jonathan Franzen,\u201d the editor of the Audubon magazine wrote in response to the essay, which itself was a response to the Audubon Society.) Had they even read the work? Had they fact-checked? Ultimately, it didn\u2019t matter. He had to look at those essays again. A writer doesn\u2019t write to be misunderstood.\n\nAnd yet how does one respond? Those incidents, which have come to number many, had begun to precede him more loudly than his proudest contributions to the world: his novels, which number five. This is a problem, because as much as he (to some controversy) is the symbol (to some controversy) of the White Male Great American Literary Novelist for the 21st Century (to much controversy), he is also someone who has to sell books. And lately, Golomb, a maternal figure whom he privately calls the \u201ctawny lioness of publishing,\u201d had been wringing her hands over the fact that people don\u2019t seem to understand him or his good intentions \u2014 that she can\u2019t figure out when exactly they all turned on him. It was the kind of thing that Franzen would like to ignore, but in addition to being a process guy, he is also a team guy. He likes to fulfill his obligations. He likes to go on book tours. He likes to do right by his publisher.\n\nAnd, well, sales of his novels have decreased since \u201cThe Corrections\u201d was published in 2001. That book, about a Midwestern family enduring personal crises, has sold 1.6 million copies to date. \u201cFreedom,\u201d which was called a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d in the first paragraph of its New York Times review, has sold 1.15 million since it was published in 2010. And 2015\u2019s \u201cPurity,\u201d his novel about a young woman\u2019s search for her father and the story of that father and the people he knew, has sold only 255,476. The Los Angeles Times called it \u201cconsuming and extraordinarily moving.\u201d\n\nWhat had he done that was so wrong? Here he was, in his essays and interviews, making informed, nuanced arguments about the way we live now \u2014 about anything from Twitter (which he is against) to the way political correctness has been weaponized to shut down discourse (which he is against) to obligatory self-promotion (which he is against) to the incessant ending of a phone call by saying, \u201cI love you\u201d (which he is against, but because \u201cI love you\u201d is for private) \u2014 and though critics loved him and he had a devoted readership, others were using the very mechanisms and platforms that he warned against (like the internet in general and social media in specific) to ridicule him. Hate-pieces, mean hashtags, reductive eye-rolling at his various stances, a nit-picking of every quote. Accusations that he is willing to pontificate but not to listen. Accusations that he\u2019s too fragile to face his accusers! Him! Too fragile!"
