This is a story about the best fast food fried chicken.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not going to be the best you\u2019ve ever had, when you need a quick fix around various parts of the country, this fried chicken will be there for you.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, I ate fried chicken from five chains that do it well \u2015 Church\u2019s Chicken, Popeye\u2019s, Shake Shack, Chick-fil-A and KFC \u2015 and ranked them. I selected these chains in particular because they\u2019re in most areas of the country (sorry, regional chains like Bojangles).\n\nWhy did I include outliers like Shake Shack and Chick-fil-A, even though they don\u2019t make traditional fried chicken? First of all, they might not offer chicken as part of a two-piece meal, but they do serve fried chicken, which makes them eligible. And secondly, I judged their chicken on its own merit and not the sandwich as a whole. I didn\u2019t want certain elements of the sandwich like a fantastic bun (hello, Chick-fil-A!) to distract from the main event: the chicken. And this is all about the fried chicken.\n\nIf you think that\u2019s unfair or stupid, you\u2019ve probably not read this sentence, and have already skipped to writing about how unfair and stupid this article is in the comments.\n\nHere is America\u2019s best (fast food) fried chicken, from good to great."

The U.S. president responded abruptly to Turnbull by saying: \u201cYou are worse than I am.\u201d He was right. Australia imprisons asylum-seekers in \u201coffshore detention centers,\u201d the euphemism the nation\u2019s politicians use for the prisons on three remote islands \u2015 Manus Island, Christmas Island and the tiny Micronesian nation of Nauru. It has been reprimanded by the United Nations for treating asylum-seekers like criminals and for violating the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Yet Australia, which is a wealthy nation with a skilled labor shortage, has continued to exile thousands of people fleeing oppression, war, discrimination, dictatorship, persecution, and attacks by criminal and terrorist groups to indefinite sentences in prisons in the middle of a silent ocean. I am one of them. I have been imprisoned on Manus Island for five years. In Iran, I was a journalist, and I fled rather than live under state surveillance. I came to Australia \u2015 first flying to Indonesia and then taking a boat \u2015 seeking safety and freedom. Instead, the government locked me up, along with hundreds of other desperate people, including women and children. \u201cThat is a good idea,\u201d Trump told Turnbull during their phone call. \u201cWe should do that, too.\u201d\n\nI came to Australia ... seeking safety and freedom. Instead, the Australian government locked me up, along with hundreds of other desperate people.\n\nFor years, my fellow prisoners and I have suffered as the Australian government inflicts emotional, psychological and physical torture on us. There is no adequate medical care and no psychological services to help us deal with the trauma we have endured. For many refugees, the conditions under which Australia warehouses us are literally unbearable. Since 2014, 12 asylum-seekers have died in these island detention centers. Last month, a 52-year-old Rohingya refugee died by suicide on Manus Island. He had fled genocide in Myanmar and sought safety in Australia. Instead, the husband and father of three \u2015 a 12-year-old, an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old \u2015 died in Australian custody having never even met his youngest child. Barely a week ago, a young man from Iran took his own life, too. The 26-year-old was incarcerated with his mother and 7-year-old brother in a family prison on Nauru. In these island prisons, it is common for children to harm and even try to kill themselves. There have been incidents of physical and sexual abuse by guards, and children have been placed in solitary confinement. Only a small selection of these incidents have been reported in the media, and the government has tried to silence nurses and doctors who treat refugees on the islands and want to speak to the press about what they have witnessed. This is the kind of system Trump has admired from afar \u2015 and now he is trying to copy it.\n\nEoin Blackwell / AAP / Reuters Asylum-seekers look through a fence at the Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea on March 21, 2014.\n\nJust a few days ago, during a hearing on a resolution to condemn the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, Australia\u2019s Greens Sen. Nick McKim said that his country\u2019s mistreatment of refugees has \u201cinspired the likes of Donald Trump and other far-right regimes around the world, and Donald Trump admitted last week that he looked at what Australia is doing ... before he came up with his appalling policy of ripping children from their families.\u201d Last week, Trump declared an end to his own policy of separating families, with plans to replace it with a program of indefinite family detention of the kind Australia has practiced for years. I write from the darkness of the prison on Manus Island to beg the American public: Do all you can to prevent your government from solidifying this inhumane policy. The Australian public did not and the consequences have been devastating. Over these years, I have come to know the pain and anguish of the men, women and little children on these islands. There is nothing harder to watch than the affliction of a father or mother whose child is suffering. There is no deeper despair than that of a parent who is helpless to protect their child. As I write, there are many fathers around me who have not seen their children in five years. I see the consequences of this form of torture, how deeply it affects them. Eventually, it annihilates them. There are fathers incarcerated here who are pushed to the edge of madness by their desire to see and embrace their children. They have one dream, and one dream only: to hold their little sons or daughters in their arms again.\n\nThere are fathers incarcerated here who are pushed to the edge of madness by their desire to see and embrace their children."

The Staircase (French) -- Netflix\n\nNetflix\n\nIt's a French docu-series, which has been directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade (Murder on a Sunday Morning). The show is a pioneer in the true-crime genre as it was launched much before Making a Murderer and Serial made the idea of a true crime thriller popular. It's compelling and mysterious and makes you think about the flaws in the legal system.\n\n2. Asha Jaoar Majhe (Labor of Love) -- Amazon Prime Video\n\nAmazon\n\nIt's a beautiful, lyrical, heartbreaking romance about an ordinary couple that remains unnamed throughout. The director, Aditya Vikram Sengupta, won the Best Debut award at the Venice Film Festival in 2014 and totally deserved it. It's a great film.\n\n3. Angamaly Diaries -- Netflix\n\nNetflix\n\nThis Malayalam crime drama was one of the best films of last year but due to a limited release, not a lot of people got the chance to watch it. It's finally on Netflix, where non-Malayali speakers can watch it with subtitles. It's a crazy film with a fantastic ending.\n\n4. Trapped -- Amazon Prime Video\n\nAmazon\n\nIt's simply the most challenging role I've taken. Although it had a decent run at the box-office, I'd encourage more people to see it as the Internet can give a whole new lease of life to a movie.\n\n5. Love\n\nNetflix\n\nIt's a searing look at the complexities of love but with a comedic flair. Features some great performances by Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust and some wonderful, true-to-life writing by their team of writers, led by the fantastic Judd Apatow.\n\n6. Sacred Games -- Netflix\n\nNetflix\n\nIt's our big debut in the global TV series market and it's a job well done. The scale, the performances, and the direction, Mumbai has never looked darker and more sinister than it does in this adaptation of Vikram Chandra's novel.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

But the latest controversy \u2013 the accusation that he is glamourising gun violence with a large new tattoo \u2013 has sparked a bitter row about racism, representation and the power of role-models in the sport.\n\nSterling has been widely criticised by anti-violence groups after he posted an image of his new body art \u2013 an M16 assault rifle. It triggered outrage in parts of the press, but so far, the 23-year-old\u2019s only comment on the matter has been to say it has \u201cdeeper meaning\u201d, and relates to when his father was shot dead when he was just two years old.\n\nBut many of his young fans see the tabloid interpretation differently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to show you can turn bad things into a positive,\u201d says Migel Ramirez, a 12-year-old football lover at the Archbishop Lafranc Academy in Croydon. \u201cTo follow your dreams, and let things motivate you to keep striving.\u201d\n\nLike many of his friends who participate in special coaching sessions organised by the charity, Football Beyond Borders, Ramirez is unequivocal in his support for the footballer. \u201cIt\u2019s because his dad was shot dead in Jamaica, and that\u2019s motivated him to only shoot with his right foot and never touch a gun,\u201d he said."

North Korea experts, however, called the agreement \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cold news\u201d \u2014 and pointed out that it falls short of goals the U.S. outlined prior to the Singapore summit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on Monday that the \u201ccomplete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept\u201d from Pyongyang. Tuesday\u2019s agreement included a commitment by Kim to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean peninsula, but the terms \u201cverifiable\u201d and \u201cirreversible\u201d were conspicuously absent from the document. It failed to explicitly define the scope of denuclearization, and didn\u2019t outline how North Korea might go about achieving it. Speaking to reporters a few hours after the signing ceremony, Trump said the two world leaders had agreed to engage in \u201cvigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible,\u201d though he provided no timetable for future talks. When pressed to explain what exactly \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d means, Trump said only that the process would be done as \u201cfast as can be done scientifically [and] mechanically.\u201d\n\nQ: What timetable do you envision for denuclearization and ease of any sanctions?\n\n\n\nTrump: Scientifically you have to wait certain periods of time...Sanctions will come off when we are sure the nukes are no longer effective. #TrumpKimSummit #tictocnews pic.twitter.com/XpXG6Xs7a4 \u2014 TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) June 12, 2018\n\nMintaro Oba, a former State Department expert on the Koreas, characterized the summit agreement as a \u201cwarm and fuzzy pile of generalities and old news.\u201d \u201cThe statement contained positions that are already well-established (like North Korean commitment to denuclearization \u2018of the Korean Peninsula,\u2019 and desire to work toward a \u2018peace regime\u2019 on the peninsula),\u201d Oba told HuffPost in an email, referring to similar promises made by Kim in April during his landmark meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Vipin Narang, an MIT professor of international relations, noted that the language in Tuesday\u2019s agreement bears striking similarities to a U.S.-North Korea declaration from 1993. \u201cRemember when they remade the movie Karate Kid 25 years later? That\u2019s what this is,\u201d Narang wrote on Twitter. Oba said the outcome was, however, \u201clargely expected given the complexity of these issues and the seriousness of North Korea\u2019s interest in maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent.\u201d He added that he would be keenly interested in whether follow-up talks led by Pompeo will lead to \u201csustainable, longer-term diplomatic\u201d ties between the two nations. Pompeo said on Monday that the United States had been \u201cfooled before\u201d by Pyongyang. \u201cMany presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper, only to find that the North Koreans either didn\u2019t promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on their promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018V\u2019 matters,\u201d Pompeo continued, referring to verification. \u201cWe are going to ensure that we set up a system sufficiently robust that we\u2019re able to verify these outcomes.\u201d Asked at Tuesday\u2019s press conference about the \u201cV\u201d word, Trump insisted that North Korea\u2019s denuclearization efforts \u201cwill be verified.\u201d When quizzed on how that would be accomplished, however, Trump replied that it would be \u201cachieved by having a lot of people there ... combinations of both\u201d American officials and international representatives.\n\n.@MajorCBS: Did you discuss methods to verify the process of denuclearization?\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cYes, we did \u2026 it will be achieved by having a lot of people there and as we develop a certain trust. And we think we have done that.\u201d https://t.co/0GKdLYDYlc pic.twitter.com/Iu8M4iQoce \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) June 12, 2018\n\nThe president added that some things had been agreed to after the deal was signed because there hadn\u2019t been \u201cenough time\u201d during the summit. He said, for instance, that Kim had promised to destroy a \u201cmajor\u201d missile testing site. He did not elaborate. Satellite imagery published last week by 38 North, a website devoted to North Korea analysis, indicating that the country had razed a \u201ckey missile test stand.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if this is what Trump was referring to. Trump said the U.S. had agreed to stop playing \u201cwar games\u201d with Pyongyang, referring to the joint military exercises with South Korea that Kim has condemned in the past. He added that he wants to \u201cbring our soldiers back home\u201d from South Korea, but said troop withdrawal was \u201cnot part of the equation right now.\u201d Some commentators skewered the president for what they called a \u201cvague\u201d agreement.\n\nNo verifiability provisions. No inspection provisions. Trump seems to have offered troop reductions and a freeze in military exercises. Details fuzzy -- but any US President other than Trump would be excoriated by both parties for such a weak, vague agreement #NorthKoreaSummit \u2014 Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) June 12, 2018\n\nThe more Trump talks about the deal, the worse it sounds. U.S. stops exercises, pledges to remove troops, no new sanctions, all in exchange for vague promises of denuclearization. #trumpkim \u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump says he\u2019s so different from past presidents. But he just signed a vague agreement with North Korea that talks about denuclearization with no real assurance they will ever do it. Sounds like Clinton and Bush to me. \u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump boasted that this agreement far exceeded skeptics' expectations. What we've seen so far is precisely the kind of vague and commitment-free agreement that skeptics expected. (Though some still believe the diplomacy itself is worthwhile.) \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump has abandoned American preparedness in exchange for vague North Korean promises, that have been broken before, and no secure means of verification. History & preparation matter. https://t.co/XYwW3KUJxi \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) June 12, 2018\n\nSome also pointed out that three of the four points outlined in the memorandum echoed Kim\u2019s agenda for the meeting, as outlined by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency prior to the summit.\n\nWhat KCNA said Kim Jong Un wanted.....and what he got.

			"text": "The Science Of Love In The 21st Century Eve Fairbanks\n\nOnce upon a time, in the Pony Expresso cafe in Seattle, a man and a woman began to experience the long-mysterious but increasingly scientifically investigated thing we call love. The first stage is called \"limerence.\" This is the spine-tingling, heart-twisting, can't-stop-staring feeling, when it seems as though the world stops whirling and time itself bows down and pauses before the force of your longing. The man, a then-44-year-old University of Washington research psychologist named John Gottman, was drawn to the woman's wild mane of black curly hair and her creativity: She was an amateur musician and painter as well as a psychologist like himself. The woman, a then-35-year-old named Julie Schwartz, who'd placed a personal ad in the Seattle Weekly that John had answered, was turned on by John's humble little car\u2014voted the ugliest vehicle in the University of Washington faculty parking lot\u2014and his expansive curiosity. He read physics and math and history and kept a little spiral-bound notebook in his pocket that he used to jot down things his companions said that captivated him. They talked avidly; it felt as if they'd known each other forever. Over the following months they drew closer and closer, proceeding through subsequent stages of building a fulfilling love relationship. John learned about the unhappy home life growing up in Michigan that had driven Julie to spend so much time in the forest by herself, and Julie learned about John's desire to understand deeply earth's biggest mysteries, like the nature of time. Although they were afraid\u2014they'd both been divorced before\u2014they confided their admiration for each other, John's for the courage Julie showed in her therapy practice by helping the \u201csickest of the sickest,\u201d schizophrenics and Vietnam veterans on Skid Row, and Julie's for John's absurdist sense of humor. They kayaked together. They joined a synagogue. They married and had a daughter, fulfilling one of John's longtime dreams, and bought a house on a forested island three hours north of Seattle, fulfilling a dream of Julie's. They fought. They attended couples therapy. Through their conflict they came to love each other more. Twenty-nine years after that first date, John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman stood on a black stage in a ballroom of the Seattle Sheraton in front of about 250 other couples, young and old, straight and gay. The intense intimacy of their relationship was on full display: They finished each other's sentences, bantered with each other and talked candidly about how their struggles had made them stronger. Julie wept. John held Julie, caressing her hair. The rest of us, seated in chairs that had been hooked together in sets of twos, watched them with yearning. We'd come to see the Gottmans because the pair has spent the last 20 years refining a science-based method to build a beautiful love partnership yourself. They reveal it over a two-day, $750-per-pair workshop called \"The Art and Science of Love.\" \u201cIt turns out Tolstoy was wrong,\" John told the crowd in an opening lecture. \"All happy relationships are similar and all unhappy relationships are also similar. \u2026 Is there a secret? It turns out, empirically, yes, there is a secret.\" Over decades, John has observed more than 3,000 couples longitudinally, discovering patterns of argument and subtle behaviors that can predict whether a couple would be happily partnered years later or unhappy or divorced. He has won awards from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Council of Family Relations and has become the subject of increasing public fascination. He went on Oprah and the \u201cToday\u201d show. A book he co-authored that summarizes his findings, Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, is a New York Times best-seller. His work took off because the consistency of his predictions is astonishing. One 1992 experiment found that certain indicators in how couples talked about their relationship could forecast\u2013with 94 percent accuracy\u2013which pairs would stay together. This was magic\u2013a virtually foolproof way of distinguishing toxic partnerships from healthy ones even before the couples knew themselves\u2013but it was also science, so it appealed to our contemporary desire to use empirical data to better our lives. Walk by any newsstand, or trawl the Internet for three minutes, and you\u2019ll find data-driven methods to improve everything we do. \u201cIs This the Ultimate Healthy Meal?\u201d \u201cThe Best Workout Ever, According to Science.\u201d You might expect love to be the last frontier breached by data. It is the Antarctic of the human experience, richly feeding the oceans of our emotions, yet somehow remaining elusive and unknown. Philosophers have argued over it for millennia without arriving at a satisfactory definition. Poets like Erich Fried capture its strange mix of pleasure and pain, the sense of its essential ungovernability: \u201cIt is foolish, says caution / It is impossible, says experience / It is what it is, says love.\u201d I first encountered Gottman's research last year in an Atlantic article called \"Masters of Love.\" It went viral; my own friends posted it on Facebook saying, \"This is what it comes down to.\u201d Finally, love had been harnessed in the laboratory, seen, understood and broken into building blocks we could all apply to our lives. The article proposes a recipe for becoming a love \u201cmaster\u201d instead of a love \u201cdisaster\u201d by responding the right way to what Gottman calls your partner's \"bids for connection.\u201d A \u201cbid\u201d is when your lover points out your kitchen window and marvels, \"Look at that beautiful bird outside!\" You could go \"Wow!\u201d and get binoculars (an active \u201cturn-towards\u201d); mumble \u201cHuh,\" and keep reading your newspaper (a passive reaction, less good); or say, \"I'm sick of your fucking birds. What about the broken garage door?\" Gottman found that masters turn towards their partners\u2019 bids 87 percent of the time. Love, he concluded, comes down to \"a habit of mind.\u201d And habits of mind take work to instill. Everyone at the workshop was given a kit in a box with a handle. Inside were decks of cards proposing questions to help us learn about our partners (\u201chow are you feeling now about being a mother?\u201d) or offering ways to connect erotically (\u201cwhen you return home tonight, greet each other with a kiss that lasts at least six seconds\u201d). A manual provided us with a vocabulary to demystify and contain some of the scary things that go on in love: fights are \"regrettable incidents,\" the things that make us feel good together are our \u201crituals of connection,\u201d the dark inner chasms that regrettable incidents seem to reveal are our \"enduring vulnerabilities.\" One of the Gottmans\u2019 employees, Kendra Han, estimated that a quarter of the couples in attendance were the kind of ickily self-aware duos who try this kind of thing for \"fun and enrichment\" while the majority were in some state of \"relational distress.\" The prevailing mood was a mix of hope and fragility. \"This is already not going well,\" I overheard one woman say, laughing a little. \"My husband\u2019s late.\u201d As I watched the Gottmans from my own seat two rows from the stage, I felt anxious, too. I had come with my own love problem to solve.\n\nSome traditional Arab cultures believed that when you fall in love, your lover steals your liver. The ancient Chinese told their children that love could take out your heart. Romantic love, in older human cultures, was often something dark. It involved physical dissolution, the sense of falling apart. It made us act irrationally and tore a hole into the neatly woven fabric of our lives, beckoning us to step through it into a land of terrors. \u201cYou get lots of stories of getting tricked,\u201d William Jankowiak, an anthropologist who has extensively studied love in folktales, told me. That\u2019s why, for much of human history, the marriage historian Stephanie Coontz writes, people thought lifelong partnership was \u201ctoo important\u201d to be left up to love. Marriage was a business contract. Families used it to acquire lands, to create stable legacies on which their next generations could build. Love resisted these kinds of reasoned considerations. That all began to change in the West in the 1700s. The rise of wage labor freed young people from their families and gave them more autonomy to decide whom to marry. The Enlightenment put freedom of choice into vogue. The word \u201cspinster\u201d emerged, a pathetic figure compared to blissful women in love. John began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. Simon May, a British philosopher who has studied the development of beliefs about love over two millennia of Western culture, suggests that we\u2019ve placed vastly more importance on finding love since the retreat of Christianity and the rise of relativism. \"Human love,\" he writes in his magisterial Love: A History, \"is widely tasked with achieving what once only divine love was thought capable of: to be our ultimate source of meaning and happiness, and of power over suffering and disappointment.\" The grounding we used to find in devotion to ideals like nationalism or communism, or in our faith in an ever-caring Shepherd, we now seek from individual, fickle human beings. After I read May\u2019s theory that love \u201cis now the West\u2019s undeclared religion,\u201d I began to see evidence of it everywhere. \u201cWhen you get down to it \u2026 [love is] the only purpose grand enough for a human life,\u201d writes Sue Monk Kidd in The Secret Life of Bees. At funerals, we praise the way the deceased person loved as the ultimate sign that his life had meaning. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Supreme Court opinion legalizing gay marriage nationally, identified marriage as the ultimate wellspring of all the other essential human joys, from \u201cexpression\u201d to \u201cspirituality,\u201d while Sheryl Sandberg counsels young women that their choice of a mate is the most important decision of their lives. According to May, we no longer view love as \"the rarest of exceptions,\" as older cultures did, \"but as a possibility open to practically all who have faith in it.\" These expectations are crazy-making, and it\u2019s no wonder scientists have jumped in to try to save us. In the 1930s, sociologists began to generate charts to try to predict what kinds of love marriages would last a lifetime. You could take your own personality traits\u2014loves sewing circles?\u2014and plot them against your beau\u2019s to forecast the happiness and stability of your match. 1 1 One of the first of these charts, created by Ernest Burgess in a book called Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, borrowed the variables from studies on whether criminals relapsed after being let out of prison. Starting the \u201970s, with divorce on the rise, social psychologists got into the mix. Recognizing the apparently opaque character of marital happiness but optimistic about science\u2019s capacity to investigate it, they pioneered a huge array of inventive techniques to study what things seemed to make marriages succeed or fail. They had partners write down everything they hated or loved about each other and then studied how close the pair subsequently sat together on a couch. They even generated fights, instructing couples to argue over how to pack the car for a vacation while each partner twiddled dials under the laboratory table assessing their mate\u2019s helpfulness. One study showed that couples who did novel things together fared better; another revealed that intense emotions, once believed to be a sign of immaturity in love, could be worked with to create very deep intimacy. Given how central our love partner had become to our well-being\u2014research had begun to show a good marriage was more predictive of long-term health than eating right or not smoking\u2014Sue Johnson of the Ottawa Couple and Family Institute told me she felt like she was \u201cin the most exciting revolution that\u2019s happened in the 20th century for human beings.\u201d \u201cImagine proving all those poets and philosophers from way back wrong!\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, we can make sense of love and actually shape it with deliberation.\u201d\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nOne recent afternoon, the Gottmans met me in their downtown Seattle office to talk about John\u2019s research and how they turned it into the Gottman Method. Julie was wearing a turqoise shirt and big earrings, her thick black curls streaked with a Susan Sontag ribbon of white. John, smaller and eagle-nosed, wore a black jacket and a yarmulke over a fringe of white hair. He'd brought his omnipresent scratch pad with him. \"A few years after we'd married,\u201d John began, \u201cI wanted to leave for Chicago to take a job there. But Julie felt Chicago was too flat. And then we were in that canoe\u2014\" Julie interrupted him sharply. \"Well, that came a bit later,\" she said. \"The real story here is we decided to offer a parenting support group. Remember that?\" \"Oh, yeah,\" John deferred. \"I forgot about that.\" Seeing the Gottmans' marital interaction up close is almost alarming at first. Most couples tone down the perpetual spats, adjustments, sideways glances and hopeful asides that constitute one-on-one intimacy when they're in public. The Gottmans don't. Sitting across from them at a conference table, you feel as though you\u2019ve come upon them tucked into bed, working it out with each other. They exchange constant meaningful looks. They interrupt each other, or Julie mostly interrupts John, correcting his behavior and memory. John accepts it. They use couples-therapy language. (\"Boundaries!\" Julie reminds John, when he starts speaking about his ex-wife.) They openly refer to deep wounds in their relationship. They also snuggle. John puts his arm around Julie, she arches into him and they wrinkle their noses at each other. In my presence, Julie wept twice, once recounting a time John had made her feel like a bad mother and once when John said she had been \u201cthe answer to my prayers.\u201d They started their parenting support group in 1989\u2013just 10 couples, once a week, talking about the ups and downs of having children at the Seattle Jewish Community Center. John approached it like a lab. \u201cHe was all about observing and learning,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnd I would jump in and talk about their emotions, looking for ways to try to help these parents. We'd have these great discussions afterwards and laugh about it. 'Why are you trying to help these people?' John would say. And I'd say, 'Honey, why are you not trying to help?'\" When John got his start researching couples in the mid-1970s, he was the one who needed help. He\u2019d grown up in Brooklyn and New Jersey a diminutive nerd with few friends. As an adult, his love life felt perpetually unstable and unhappy. He found it hard to be satisfied with the woman he was with. In one two-year relationship, he and a girlfriend argued so much he ended up with stress-induced pneumonia. Psychology, which he studied at the University of Wisconsin, gave him a way to use his problem-solving mind to attack the question of his own loneliness. Like a science-fiction android who pins electrodes on his human subjects to try to figure out where their emotions come from, John set about creating experiments that were as broad as possible: What does a good relationship look like? What does it feel like to be in it? His career took off when he met a psychologist named Robert Levenson. Each man turned out to be exactly what the other had needed. Levenson was investigating the remarkable variance in how different people react to stress by testing their heart rates and sweat-gland activity after receiving a jolt. By teaming up with John, he says he finally felt as if he was working on something more \u201cpersonally relevant and emotionally rich\u201d than administering electric shocks. Meanwhile, by joining with Levenson, John thought he might uncover a way to measure marital happiness that was more \u201creal\u201d than people\u2019s self-reporting on surveys. Their collaboration led John to create an actual mock apartment where couples could do \u201cordinary\u201d things like cook and watch TV together. \u201cIt was just like being at a bed and breakfast,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept you were hooked up to electrodes \u2026 and there were surveillance cameras hanging from the ceiling.\u201d Then, he harnessed the emerging power of computers to analyze a vast amount of data from the interactions. Professionals trained in interpreting facial expressions evaluated hours of video, rating the couples for emotions like delight, disgust and fear; assistants coded questionnaires the partners filled out about their relationship history for positive and negative feelings; and machines took constant measures of the couples\u2019 heart rates and vascular tone while they flirted and fought. Years afterwards, the psychologists followed up to see which couples were happy and which had split up. They plugged that information into a computer, along with all the data they\u2019d previously gathered, and asked the machine to create equations that associated certain behaviors and physiology with long-term happiness. What emerged were fascinating and often surprising observations on lasting love. They found that couples that stay happy used a lot of \u201cwe,\u201d whereas couples that turned out unhappy used \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d They also discovered that when partners with a good long-term outlook argued, they somehow managed to maintain a ratio of five positive comments to one negative one. \u201cAt the time, everybody was enamored with this idea that romantic relationships were full of fireworks,\u201d Levenson remembered. \u201cWell, that was not the finding. It is the capacity of couples to calm down, to soothe, to sort of reduce the level of arousal for each other, that is the most important factor in predicting whether the marriage will last.\u201d In the beginning, the two men\u2019s techniques were viewed as dangerously iconoclastic. \u201cWhen Bob and I were assistant professors getting evaluated for tenure our committee said, \u2018Look, you guys are crazy. We can\u2019t predict one person\u2019s behavior. How are we going to predict two people\u2019s behavior? You\u2019ll never find anything. You\u2019ll never get a grant,\u2019\u201d John recalled. But as the astoundingly robust predictions started rolling in, all that changed. John got elected to chair the family psychology research unit of the American Psychological Association. The New York Times profiled his findings. Where John had once felt hopelessly bewildered by love, he began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. \u201cJohn had these brilliant insights,\u201d Julie told me, \u201cbut nothing was being done with them.\u201d\n\nUnlike John, Julie\u2019s work as a psychologist had centered on therapeutic interventions. The daughter of a severely emotionally unstable mother, Julie started comforting others early. \u201cIn high school, I didn\u2019t have friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a caseload.\u201d She specialized in individual and group therapy, not couples therapy, but she was fascinated by her husband\u2019s research. She also knew that the majority of people who seek individual therapy want help with their relationships. From her divorce, she was familiar with the anguish produced by difficult love. She left that marriage with nothing but a Tibetan prayer rug, a sleeping bag and a cat. Canoeing together on the Salish Sea outside Seattle, Julie remembers saying to John, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to help couples with what you know?\u201d They spent the next year creating a master theory of good relationships based on John\u2019s research. He sat in his red chair, she sat on an ottoman. \u201cWe argued a lot,\u201d John remembered. \u201cOh, God, we argued a lot,\u201d Julie said. In the beginning, John was hesitant to embrace some of the ideas about love that Julie had picked up from her decades of practice as a therapist. \u201cI thought, if there wasn\u2019t solid evidence, we wouldn\u2019t put it into the theory,\u201d he recalled. Always formula-driven, he imagined the Gottman Method would comprise a rigid set of 14 well-structured sessions. Julie wanted a looser set of guidelines. \u201cI was tearing my hair out because I had worked with people for 20, 25 years, and I knew that there\u2019s huge variation in how people react to therapy,\u201d she said. She threw John a teasing smile. \u201cHe had to learn how to respect my knowledge. Finally.\u201d They imagined that a happy relationship was built consecutively in seven layers. The foundation was a strong friendship, based on John\u2019s laboratory findings that couples who spoke more fluidly and in more detail about each other and their pasts were more likely to stay together. Then came sharing admiration, \u201cturning towards\u201d each others\u2019 bids and developing positive feelings about the coupling. Once that had all clicked into place, a pair could proceed through learning to manage their fights with, among other techniques, a process they dubbed \u201cdreams within conflict,\u201d whereby people try to see the positive dream inside what looks like a partner\u2019s negative position. At the top\u2013the pinnacle of a great relationship\u2013came helping each others' dreams come true and building a shared sense of purpose, like volunteering or traveling the world. The \u201cdreams with conflict\u201d technique was inspired by the Gottmans\u2019 own marital strife. One fight involved Julie\u2019s wish, for her 50th birthday, to climb above Mount Everest\u2019s base camp with 10 female friends. \u201cJohn gets altitude sick on a ladder,\u201d Julie said. He didn\u2019t want her to go. In bed at night, he\u2019d pepper her with questions: \u201cWhat if you get caught in a blizzard? What if you fall in a glacier? What if you get altitude sick?\u201d \u201cWhat if you get hit by a bus?\u201d she\u2019d reply. Julie invited a sherpa to their house to give a presentation on the trip. The sherpa stood in the living room, 6 feet tall, dark and sexy, and showed slides of fabulous rope bridges snaking over river chasms as her friends ooh-ed and aah-ed. Afterwards, Julie asked John what he thought of the evening. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that sherpa. I think he just wants to have sex with you 10 women,\u201d John recalled saying. \u201cI was right about that, by the way.\u201d But he came to realize what seemed like Julie\u2019s peculiar urge to \u201csleep on rocks where there\u2019s no air\u201d stemmed from her yearning for far-flung adventure born from her difficult childhood. They also fought over whether to buy a second home. It was a priority for Julie to return to living in the forest, her childhood safe space. John initially refused. Over many \u201cdreams within conflict\u201d discussions, they discovered that John\u2019s intransigence came from his own upbringing. His father, a rabbi, fled Vienna shortly before World War Two with \u201conly some sugar and a lemon.\u201d He counseled his son about the power of feeling free of possessions, including real estate, saying, \u201cThe only possessions you can count on are the ones inside your mind.\u201d Finally, after a year of bickering and breakthroughs, the Gottmans felt as if they\u2019d perfected their method, and they took on a partner to help them turn it into a business. At first, they recruited participants to their workshops by posting fliers and placing pamphlets in therapists\u2019 waiting rooms. But within a few years, such aggressive flogging wasn\u2019t needed anymore. Crowds flocked to the workshops and, later, to the Gottmans\u2019 online store, which offers products like a board game that takes you and your partner, represented by little plastic pieces, on a journey across painted cardboard through the steps to building a fulfilling relationship. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more of a burden placed on marriage now to be your social support system,\u201d Julie reflected. \u201cPeople turned out to be starving for this knowledge.\u201d\n\nI could relate. I met my boyfriend in 2009 at a dinner party I'd thrown to impress somebody else. He came in late, beautiful in his crisp work clothes. The chemistry was immediate. Over a series of dates, I learned he was sweet and giving, with strong ethics and a fascinating mind. We lived on separate sides of the country where we resided at the time, and we had heady months of meeting in romantic towns in the middle, eating figs and cherries we bought straight off of farms, learning about ourselves as we were reflected in each other. Much of the time, I think we made each other feel more capable, more hopeful for the future. But there were also times when we made each other feel more confused than we'd ever been in our lives. The desire to love each other was there, and yet it was with exasperation that we recognized we each sometimes didn't feel loved. What were we doing wrong? It didn\u2019t seem clear. During a difficult period this year, lingering at my laptop deep into the night, I found myself clicking on articles that promised to turn love into a formula. \u201c15 Ways to Stay Married for 15 Years.\u201d \u201cTen Ways to Make Your Marriage Divorce-Proof.\u201d \u201cMust-Know Guidelines for Dating an ISTJ.\u201d (Yes, I was desperate.) Like many people, I was particularly fascinated by a story in The New York Times called \"To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This.\" Based on work by Arthur Aron, a psychologist at Stony Brook University, the article proposed that love could be established if a pair of random people asked each other a specific set of 36 increasingly intimate questions (\"Would you like to be famous? In what way?\") and then silently stared into each other\u2019s eyes for four minutes. Two strangers paired for Aron's study actually ended up married six months later. It seemed to prove that love is a masterable technique rather than an uncontrollable force that often gives us pain. And people went wild for it. The article was viewed by more than 8 million people. Within weeks, Apple's App Store unveiled eight different apps based on it, one titled simply, \u201cFall in Love.\u201d And yet as fervently as I hoped one of these recipes would make my confused love life resolve itself, deep down I wasn\u2019t sure love could or should be built out of a manual, like something you assemble from IKEA. We live in an age that generally denies the possibility of the unpredictable. My and all my friends\u2019 unspoken goal is to live flawlessly plotted lives based on perfect self-knowledge. We have to-do lists and bucket lists and two-year, five-year and 20-year plans created with the help of therapists. One of my friends has jiggered his iPhone to blink him reminders of his \u201ccore values\u201d all day long, so he won\u2019t even briefly swerve astray. For me, though, love has been the thing that has broken me out of this dreary quest for perfection. We can only consciously construct what we can already imagine, which is very little. When I was 19 and living in Belgium, I happened to fall in love with a completely inappropriate man, a 33-year-old German pastor who wore white cigarette jeans like a \u201970s sitcom hustler and had spent his twenties bicycling around Europe. I never could have dreamed him up with the help of a therapist. That\u2019s what made loving him so life-altering. He was wild, irreverent, given to reading the Song of Solomon in bed and playing hooky from his internship at a theological seminary to take the train to a town he\u2019d never heard of\u2013in other words, nothing like the driven, well-scheduled East Coasters I\u2019d grown up with. And he touched those dormant qualities in myself. At the time, I wrote in a journal that being loved by him felt as if I\u2019d been living in only three cramped rooms of the mansion that was my spirit, and then he came in with a big flashlight and led me by the hand through a warren of never-seen halls, laughing and tearing the sheets off the furniture while I trailed behind him, mouth agape. Of course, his alluring differences also bashed painfully up against my longing for a partner with whom I felt comfortable all the time. He was too old, he was too odd, he smoked too much; I agonized over the thought of introducing him to my parents. I felt at the time that forcing our relationship to \u201cwork\u201d according to some norm would shatter it; it only worked insofar as it was broken, a queer, misshapen thing that just happened to rest beautifully atop the equally queer, misshapen circumstances that constituted our lives at 19 and 33. Likewise, surfing the web for the solution that would bring my more recent relationship to heel, I feared we couldn\u2019t make it conform to an ideal template. A recent Quartz article insists that when choosing a life partner, we have to search for the right \u201ceating companion for about 20,000 meals,\u201d \u201ctravel companion for about 100 vacations,\u201d \u201cparenting partner\u201d and \u201ccareer therapist\u201d\u2013all while admitting that contemplating such a project \u201cis like thinking about how huge the universe really is or how terrifying death really is.\u201d The author assures you, though, that using a spreadsheet will help you feel as if it\u2019s \u201cfully in your control.\u201d I guess this is supposed to be empowering; I suspect it actually puts relationships under a kind of pressure beneath which many would crumble. My boyfriend and I came from very different countries, from different kinds of families. That we managed to love each other at all was already a miracle. When we imagine thatevery human life and every complex love can be molded to fit a scientifically derived ideal, we cover our eyes to the realities of circumstance\u2013and shame people who can\u2019t manage to twist their circumstances to that ideal. Simon May, the philosopher who writes on love, told me that he\u2019s known people who were accused of basic psychological failings when they couldn\u2019t make their relationships work out. \u201cBut we have to take into account all the literature on unhappy love,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just people getting it wrong or not trying hard enough.\u201d He called love an \u201cearthy emotion\u201d that often provokes restless feelings like tension and guilt, and suggested the assumption that every love affair can be managed denies the full humanity of our partners, their own \u201cinscrutable and uncontrollable\u201d natures. They aren\u2019t things we can program for maximum impact like a FitBit. As I dug a little deeper into the work behind the love articles, I found that some of the people responsible for the science felt it held fewer definitive answers than we want to believe. One of them was Arthur Aron, the Stony Brook research psychologist whose work the Times glossed in \u201cTo Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This.\u201d He was working at his second home in California when I called him. He laughed when I mentioned the Times story. He\u2019d designed the 36 questions, he said, to artificially \u201ccreate closeness\u201d in a laboratory setting between same-sex heterosexual strangers, not lovers. One of his grad students had also tried the method on some heterosexual opposite-sex pairs, and one pair had, funny enough, fallen in love, but the lab hadn\u2019t followed up with the others. Aron has studied love in many other experiments, and he\u2019s been struck by how contextual factors influence relationships. \u201cUnfortunately the single biggest [factor], if you look across the world, is stress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re very poor, if you\u2019re in a crime-ridden neighborhood, it\u2019s hard for any relationship to work out very well. That\u2019s not one we can do much about as individuals.\u201d Aron also pointed out that a lot of the science on happy love was based on averages, creating a norm away from which couples can stray very, very far and still be happy. Take a recent study claiming the ideal age to marry is between 25 and 34. The study reflects the center hump of a scattered group of dots representing pairs older and younger that all work in their own way. And the reporting on it outrageously inverts causation. The study\u2019s authors mused that people who married younger might have been less settled, and those who waited until later might have been be more \u201ccongenitally cantankerous,\u201d upping their divorce rates. That doesn\u2019t mean arbitrarily marrying in your late twenties would do anything whatsoever to improve your chances. And yet, I still read a story on Vox headlined, \u201cWant to Avoid Divorce? Here\u2019s the Best Age to Get Married.\u201d John Gottman designed his experiments to allow numerous variables to emerge, creating a much richer formula. But his findings were limited by the pool from which he drew his test subjects, communities in Illinois, Washington, Indiana and the San Francisco Bay Area with their own local habits. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of big mystery at the heart of things,\u201d another psychologist told me. That psychologist was Robert Levenson\u2013the same man with whom John had pioneered his work. I reached him on the phone at Berkeley, where he now teaches. He and John are still close, and Levenson praised John\u2019s \u201cfierce interest\u201d in what makes marriages last. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that at the end of the day, after our research, he spent a significant part of his life working on interventions,\u201d Levenson reflected. But he wasn\u2019t so sure the actions he and John had observed happy couples performing could be turned into a do-it-at-home blueprint. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t know what got the happy couples to that point,\u201d he said. What makes two human beings want to turn towards each others\u2019 bids 87 percent of the time, give a shit about the fragile dreams hiding behind each others\u2019 most intransigent and frustrating opinions and have that magical effect on each other like a powerful chemical tranquilizer in the first place? This, he said, still \u201crequires scientific study.\u201d Kendra Han, the workshop employee, admitted she doesn\u2019t follow up after couples leave the conference to see whether the method made them happier. Two studies conducted by the Gottmans show that the method really can move people along a happiness spectrum: A 2000 intervention given to already-healthy couples expecting a child revealed that it helped them weather the difficulties of becoming parents, and a 2013 Journal of Family Therapy study of 80 couples showed that most maintained gains in marital satisfaction a year after \u201cThe Art and Science of Love\u201d workshop. This is less definitive than the promise to transform disasters into masters, though, and the method wasn\u2019t directly compared to other therapies. Robert Levenson told me couples-therapy purveyors can be reluctant to do comparative studies, and gave a hypothetical example of why based on the finding that happy couples use \"we\" a lot. \u201cWhat if I have the Levenson \u2018We\u2019 Therapy, where people come to my \u2018We\u2019 training and learn how to use \u2018We'?\" he asked me. \"Then I do a study and compare it with the Gottman approach and it turns out the Gottman approach does much better. But what about my \u2018We\u2019 building and my \u2018We\u2019 weekends and my \u2018We Retreat\u2019 at Club Med?\u201d\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nBack at the Gottman Method workshop, the 500 of us periodically broke out into pairs for exercises: 20 minutes to practice showing each other admiration, 30 to try to work through a serious problem that triggered our \"enduring vulnerabilities.\u201d There were tip sheets to draw out of our kits: a master list of 100 adjectives to choose from when praising our partners\u2014brave, reliable, hot\u2014and a collection of lines to use when we\u2019re overwhelmed during arguments. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m feeling flooded. Can we take 20? I\u2019d come in skeptical. But not two hours into the exercises, I found myself overwhelmed by emotion. All of the concepts were just abstract enough to find a specific analogue in my relationship. As I recognized my boyfriend\u2019s particular lovely qualities in the list of adjectives, I got a flush of warm and peaceful feelings, the kind John\u2019s laboratory research determined were necessary to support the calm physiology that underpins lasting love. A \u201clove map\u201d exercise got me to contemplate the gaps in our friendship and ways to fill them. The dreams-within-conflict exercise helped me understand the hopes for being a good dad that my boyfriend had vested in the ways he wanted to raise our future children. In their lectures, the Gottmans performed the same quirky, vulnerable marital dynamic that I observed in my interview. In one memorable hour, they role-played a past \u201cregrettable incident,\u201d first handling it in a bad way, then in a good way. As we all watched, John harshly criticized Julie for being too worried about their daughter\u2019s health. Julie slumped over the podium and actually cried. Then he started over with empathy, gently teasing out the issue from her personal history\u2013the polio she contracted as a child due to her parents\u2019 neglect. As we saw the change on Julie's face, we all drew a breath. Suddenly, altering the trajectory of those terrible fights, the ones that can feel as though they're breaking our partnerships apart, seemed possible. We saw it happen. It\u2019s not hard to find people who vow that the Gottman Method completely transformed their relationships. Last month, I called one of the thousands of couples-therapy practices that use the Gottman Method, BestMarriages in southern British Columbia, and asked for referrals to couples who were willing to talk. Several pairs emailed me, eagerly requesting to be interviewed. There\u2019s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore the awesome workings of destiny. Bonnie, 49, told me that she and her husband Brian, \u201cdefinitely a disaster couple,\u201d were going to end their union, but a year of biweekly counseling in the Gottman Method \u201ccompletely turned things around.\u201d Donald, 50, said he\u2019d also given up on his 24-year marriage to Donna. There had been affairs; the two had drifted apart. But encountering the Gottmans\u2019 lingo\u2014the \u201cenduring vulnerabilities,\u201d the \u201crituals of connection,\u201d the \u201cturning towards\u201d\u2014suddenly put meaning to the language-less, mysterious eddy of emotions that had been the relationship. It gave them things to do. Donald started sending Donna text messages every afternoon: \u201cHow was your day?\u201d When he had a difficult encounter with a testy colleague, Donna shared her admiration for him, telling him how proud she was of him for handling it well. When Donna had a cold and snored, the \u201cold Don,\u201d she said, would have roused her by \u201chuffing and puffing with annoyance.\u201d Instead, he employed the Gottmans\u2019 patented \u201csoftened start-up,\u201d waking her gently, expressing concern for her sore throat, and later sending her a note from work thanking her for rolling over to the other side of the bed. Talking to them by video Skype, I never would have known the two had struggled. They cuddled up to one another in the frame and giggled like smitten high-schoolers as they retold the story of how they met. \u201cWe spotted each other,\u201d Donna grinned, sticking her tongue out at Don. \u201cShe was on a balcony,\u201d Donald said, smiling back. \u201cIt was like Romeo and Juliet.\u201d I also got to watch Julie counsel a couple, Shantel and Paul, using the Gottman Method. The pair comes from a poorer neighborhood in Seattle, and they got free therapy in 2007 in exchange for agreeing to be filmed to help train other Gottman Method counselors. I\u2019d intended to dip in just for a few minutes to get a sense of how Julie worked. But I ended up viewing six hours of the counseling in one afternoon, transfixed. Though Paul and Shantel could hardly have seemed less like me and my partner in their particulars\u2013they had children; a low ebb in their relationship occurred after Paul got shot\u2013so much of the by-turns-playful-and-reproachful dance that they did with each other on Julie\u2019s couch reminded me of my own relationships: the flirty exchanges, the deep concern for each other, the subtle digs at each others\u2019 flaws, the sudden flares of anger as they touched each other on open wounds. Shantel wept as she recounted how Paul criticized her; Paul cried himself as he recalled being abandoned by his godmother and how he fears Shantel\u2019s rejection. I called Shantel in late July. Like the other couples I spoke to, she reckoned the Gottman Method \u201ckept us married.\u201d Since they\u2019d met as young teens, she and Paul had basically been each other\u2019s only ports in an incredibly stormy world. In his teens, Paul got involved in the drug trade; later, the pair got caught up in the predatory lending crisis and briefly became homeless. Add to that the fact that they had not selected each other to ride out this turmoil on the basis of a problem-solving-compatibility survey but on love, which often, like a trickster determined to upend our tidy plans, draws opposites together and, by reminding us of our emotionally fraught childhood bonds with our parents, brutally reveals just how vulnerable and childlike we really still are. Add to that the fact that our culture teaches us to expect love to \u201cfeel right,\u201d to feel like a peaceful resolution rather than an adventure, to feel as calm as faith. \u201cEvery time we got into a huge argument, we thought it must not be \u2018meant to be,\u2019\u201d Shantel said. Julie\u2019s techniques gave them a way to navigate the astounding complexity that is a marriage based on love. \u201cOne of the biggest things is being able to notice when we are \u2018flooded\u2019 and when we are at a place we can\u2019t even engage and giving each other that space,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe love telling each other when we\u2019re \u2018turning towards\u2019 each other. \u2018Hey, I\u2019m making an attempt here to turn towards you. What I did was wrong. It was unfair.\u2019 And the other person is receptive to that because we both have an understanding of what it means.\u201d In private, the Gottmans are much more nuanced on the impossibility of healing some relationships than they are in public. \u201cSometimes, really, people\u2019s dreams don\u2019t mesh,\u201d John reflected. \u201cThere are all kinds of reasons why therapy can fail.\u201d I got the sense they deeply care about couples in pain\u2014they asked me several times about my own relationship. Their promise that mastering love is possible is, in part, an effort to comfort couples enmeshed in terrifying complexity. \u201cEven if you can give somebody one little nugget of something they can take in, it\u2019s helpful,\u201d Julie said. I still don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to happen with my relationship. But I left the workshop wanting to try the Gottmans\u2019 techniques. They brought to mind a line from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian: \u201cThe truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. ... Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way.\u201d The new love science may be just a string in the increasingly huge and windy maze that is contemporary love, no more absolute than all the other ways of thinking about love we\u2019ve invented over 50,000 years\u2014but we need that string.\n\nBefore I left Seattle, the Gottmans invited me out to their home on Orcas, the forested island off the northwest Washington coast. A giant silver sculpture of a heart invites visitors down a steep, wooded path towards the sea. The house\u2019s interior is a wondrous world unto itself: wood carvings, ochre-and-sienna Native American-inspired throw blankets, shelves and shelves of books, a wooden dining-room table painted with playful injunctions. Enjoy the fruits of your labors. Open your mind. Seek knowledge. Seize the day. Cherish the night. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly Julie,\u201d John said proudly as we tucked our feet into sheepskin slippers. \u201cShe\u2019s a frustrated architect.\u201d He stopped in front of a huge oil portrait just off the foyer depicting the two Gottmans together, smiling and leaning into each other. A friend had painted it. \u201cI love this because it really captures our relationship,\u201d he said. He paused for a moment before the painting as if to take it in anew. Settling into their brown couches, I asked John and Julie if they felt the pain depicted in the millennia of literature on love, the ups and downs and the sense of bewilderment we now try to manage, was somehow necessary, or if better science could increase our skill at love such that we wouldn\u2019t have to go through such torment anymore. Both fell silent for 20 seconds. \u201cI think the pain has to do with balance, and how difficult it is to balance between attending to your partner\u2019s needs and staying true to who you are,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI have a different answer,\u201d John said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. When you haven\u2019t been able to build trust, there\u2019s the constant sense that this person isn\u2019t there for you. They\u2019re there for themselves but not for you. But we now know that there are really systematic processes through which people build trust and commitment.\u201d Recently, he\u2019d been working on the mathematics of building trust in relationships based on John Nash\u2019s concept of the cooperative equilibrium, where two players in a game seek the best possible outcome for both of them. But he also acknowledged that his painful younger relationships were steps on the path to Julie, showing him what he really wanted and how he needed to change. Julie said the same of her first marriage. If everybody involved had known then what you know now about how to build a good relationship, I asked, could you have made your earlier marriages work? \u201cNo,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d John said. There\u2019s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore not the scientifically based steps by which they built their coupledom but rather the awesome workings of destiny. I got the sense this story was more important to them than the other one. Revealing it, they curled closer together on the couch, Julie nestling her head into the crook of John\u2019s neck, John massaging her leg. Two years before she met John, Julie said, she\u2019d had a vision of the man she would spend her life with. Her vision had shown the man from behind. When John got up from the table to pay the bill on their first date at the Pony Expresso, and turned around, she felt a shock so sudden it left her trembling: It was him, the man from her vision. Later, she came to believe fate had brought them together for the higher purpose of helping couples: \u201cI see our predestiny, the sacred holiness, as to do this little tiny bit of healing as tikkun olam\u201d\u2013Jews\u2019 duty to repair the world. Julie\u2019s scientist brain knows that feelings of intense attraction come down to hormones and pheromones, but, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put that together with the fact that I had this vision of him.\u201d Perhaps, someday, a scientifically observable process will allow us to understand exactly what it is, that sense of mysterious destiny we can find in other people, not created but seemingly sent from on high. But is that a world in which we\u2019d actually want to live? John smiled as he recounted the puzzling sensation he experienced that evening in the Pony Expresso, similar to Julie\u2019s. He\u2019d been unhappy for decades. In the months before that encounter, he said he\u2019d gone on 60 dates, trying to establish a \u201cdatabase\u201d of women to choose from. And then he met Julie and felt unaccountably whole. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt alone since,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Julie murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me cry.\u201d\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax1_caption"

There are so many important questions, right from financial planning to stocking up on baby essentials, and most of all, picking a perfect name for your child.\n\nNumerous studies conducted over the years reveal the consequences that an unusual or culturally loaded name can have on a child's future, right from their self-esteem to the job opportunities they get. Nevertheless, many parents are opting for names that are unique and make their child stand out. It's but natural for parents to wonder -- \"How offbeat should we go with our baby's name?\"\n\nIf you don't want to take a risk with your choice of name for your baby but still want to ensure it makes an impact, we've got you covered.

One of the main reasons you feel rough right now is because you\u2019re dehydrated. Aim to drink water during your night of partying and if you don\u2019t (which, let\u2019s face it, is quite likely) make sure you drink plenty the following morning.\n\nDon\u2019t Try To Sweat It Out In The Gym\n\nDoing some exercise may well make you feel better than lying in bed, but don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re sweating out the alcohol: Mark Leyshon, senior policy and research officer at Alcohol Concern says that is, quite simply, a myth.\n\n\u201cNo amount of exercise can reduce the effects of a hangover, so it\u2019s better to rest and drink plenty of water rather than engaging in vigorous activity, he said.\n\n\u201cExercise can make you feel a bit better after drinking, but it\u2019s not possible to sweat out the alcohol. Only time will get the booze out of your bloodstream.\u201d\n\nGet At Least One Of Your Five A Day\n\nIt is so tempting to just eat terribly when you feel hungover, but you\u2019re only going to prolong the agony. A vegetable juice or smoothie is an easy way of getting some vitamins and nutrients if your stomach isn\u2019t feeling too good.\n\nAvoid A Fry Up\n\nSpeaking of eating terribly, greasy foods are not your friend right now. A full English may give you heartburn, make you feel bloated and generally just punish your body even more than you have already done.\n\nAnd the old wive\u2019s tale about carbohydrates saving you by soaking up the alcohol, only really applies if you eat them the night before, not the morning after.\n\nInstead, stick to food that\u2019s easy to digest such as eggs, toast and bananas.\n\nTake Some Painkillers\n\nFinally, NHS Choices advises knocking back a couple of painkillers to relieve your headache."

Indian banks want to recover more than $1 billion that Indian authorities say Kingfisher owes.\n\nThe British court order allows the UK High Court Enforcement Officer to enter Mallya's properties in Britain, giving a legal option to Indian banks to try and recover the dues, media reports said, citing the court decision.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to confirm the court decision.\n\nSeparately, the Indian government's Enforcement Directorate, which fights financial crimes, has filed an application to seek to declare Mallya a \"fugitive economic offender\" and sought to confiscate 125 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) worth of his assets.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, Mallya said he was trying to sell assets worth about $2.04 billion to repay creditors.\n\nMallya, who denies the charges against him, said any objection by the Enforcement Directorate or India's federal police to his proposals to sell assets \"will clearly demonstrate that there is an agenda against me beyond recovery of dues to Public Sector Banks.\"\n\n\"I have become the 'Poster Boy' of bank default and a lightning rod of public anger,\" Mallya said in his statement last week."

It was a notoriously stinky fruit.\n\nAround 500 students and staffers were evacuated from the RMIT University library so that 40 firefighters, including masked crews, could investigate the source of the smell, according to the Herald Sun. The culprit was a durian left rotting in a cupboard, Melbourne\u2019s Metropolitan Fire Brigade said in a release.\n\nThis sort of fruit-driven flight would surprise few who have come in contact with the durian, a native of Southeast Asia with an odor that has been compared to \u201cturpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock,\u201d \u201chot poop garbage\u201d and \u201cgasoline.\u201d\n\nAlthough aficionados relish durians for their creamy, sweet interior, the fruits are so polarizing that they\u2019re banned from Singapore\u2019s subway system and many hotels around Asia, according to Time.\n\nOnce authorities knew there was no danger, the building was reopened. However, Victoria state\u2019s Environment Protection Authority still had the task of removing the foul-smelling fruit from the premises, according to The Age."

There was a problem processing your signup; please try again later Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYoutube\n\nWhen the Thomson Reuters Foundation released a survey describing India the world's most dangerous country for women, the union government insisted India was that unsafe.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Rekha Sharma, the former media in-charge of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party in Haryana and the Chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW) since October 2017, rejected the survey's findings and claimed:\n\n30 percent of rape cases reported to the NCW are ultimately found to be \"fake\".\n\nIncreasing compensation for survivors of gang-rape led to a sudden rise in number of gang-rape complaints in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nSexual violence is closely related to education and the more 'gruesome' rapes India has witnessed has been perpetrated by men with less education. Educated men are guilty of sexual harassment at workplace.\n\nA large population of Bangladeshis are applying for citizenship in India, implying they feel our country is safer for them.\n\nSharma did not provide any data of her own to back up her claims.\n\nRead on for more of Sharma's insights on violence against women in India.\n\nAOL\n\nWhy did you reject the findings of the poll conducted by Thomson Reuters Foundation?\n\nThe primary problem with the survey is that it is based on the perception of a few people. The few people also, we don't know \u2014 they are not giving names or the names of the organisations they belong to. Perception, they are talking about \u2014 there's no data backing that perception. I can change my perception day to day.\n\nI see my husband changing his perception every day on one government and then on another government. One day something comes in the news about the Congress, his perception changes, again if there is something about BJP, his perception changes on BJP. So perception changes from time to time. You can't call a country unsafe because of perception, without any data.\n\nAnd they are comparing to the countries where there is no perception of women. They don't allow a perception of women -- they are comparing to those countries. Specially Saudi Arabian countries, if you see them, their women can't even go out, can't even talk to the men, can't work, a few countries have now allowed driving to women.\n\nTalking about violence, yes, violence against women is there in India. But comparatively it is much less. 2017 data shows US has more rapes than India. What has changed in one year? [While the chairman's numbers are correct, a recent analysis of government data suggests 99% of sexual assaults in India go un-reported \u2014 Ed]\n\nThe perception we are talking about is in March-April, when these things happened in J&K and in UP \u2014 these two rapes of minors happened \u2014 and all of a sudden every person was talking about sexual violence in the country.\n\nWe have a free media and hyper media.\n\nSuppose a child has fallen into a borewell. So they will cover it 24x7 on all the channels, live. So the perception will arise that government of that state is not doing anything for the child. Next day, increase the price of onions and the perception will change again. One BJP government had fallen because of hiked price of onions. Because the media had a big role to play. Every day and night they were talking about price of onions.\n\nI am not saying all is okay, all is not okay. That's why NCW is there, that's why we are working. We are everyday taking suo moto cases.\n\nWe should not be at number 10 of that survey also. Violence against women in India is more in many countries, that doesn't mean there is no violence against women in India. I need to change mindset of people \u2014 I want to reach every district.\n\nHow do you plan to do that?\n\nI will talk to my team today itself. We should have master trainers who will train others and no district in no state will remain uncovered. Every village, we have to reach there. We have to make a network.\n\nWas it necessary for the government and government bodies to reject the survey?\n\nIt was necessary. Because how people perceive your country, you know. Everybody talks about their country with so many positive things to the world. This survey is going all over the world and it is showing our country in bad light.\n\nEvery visitor from outside is not getting raped here. It is not true. Yes, things are happening, it is happening in other countries as well. That is not alright with me also. No one should get raped.\n\nBut you are projecting the country in bad light to the world. Everything is not alright. But it is not that wrong also that you tell the world that it is the number one country in violence. After Nirbhaya happened, people were talking Delhi is the rape capital of India. That is not so.\n\nBut Delhi does have the highest number of rapes in a city, according to National Crime Records Bureau data...\n\nNumber of reported rapes.\n\nThen imagine the number of actual cases...\n\nNo no no...reported means... after investigation do you follow the cases? Every reported case? What happens to kids, and similar cases after Nirbhaya, those are very bad. But many reported cases, many rape cases that come to us are not proven that it has happened. After the investigation, how many cases are proven?\n\nBut the NCRB data says otherwise...\n\nThe number of FIRs have increased. Because ways of reporting is now better than earlier. Earlier women either didn't know their rights, or police was not taking the complaints seriously and not registering FIRs.\n\nBut the general perception is the number of reported rape cases is way less than the actual number of incidents of rape. Many victims don't report the crime... the number is actually more.\n\nNo, not like that. Today only someone sent me a report that a mother has told that her minor daughter was raped, but her claims are proven wrong. This also is happening a lot. Relationship goes bad and then girl says that 'he raped me' after two years. That is reported and that thing comes out in the media. For you or any other person that number is a data that rape has increased.\n\nBut you know, being at any rank on a list of 'most dangerous countries for women' is quite bad in itself.\n\nThey have mentioned stoning \u2014 have you heard in India that India is number in stoning? That the most number of stoning is in India? Or how many times have you heard that women are being stoned to death in India?\n\nWe asked them (Thomson Reuters) for the report and the names of the experts. They said they can't send the names. They just sent the detail of the report and the number of people they talked to in each country.\n\nI think now from our country someone should get up and do a proper survey, come up with a proper report.\n\nDo you think for women in our country, or any country for that matter, these reports have a bearing on how safe or unsafe they feel? Do you think they care if they are on number 1 or number 4?\n\nI think I was reading an article where they said an interesting thing that the number of people applying for asylum in a country is a mark of how safe or unsafe that country is considered. For example, so many thousands of people are applying for asylum in the US. Whereas this survey ranks US as the 10th most dangerous country for women. So, do you think women would like to go in a country which is like that? It is okay for her?\n\nEvery year so many people are applying for Indian citizenship, specially from Bangladesh. If India is not safe \u2014 because they don't feel safe in Bangladesh, that's why they are coming to us. Why are they coming to us?\n\nThe reasoning of the survey is completely wrong.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that the laws are adequate but the implementation needs to be better. Do you think death penalty actually works as a deterrent? There's a compelling argument against it.\n\nAnything happens, there is an argument against it. I think death penalty will obviously be a deterrent. But the cases should be resolved more quickly.\n\nAlso, very few people actually end up getting the compensation for rape survivors. Why do you think that happens? Are they not aware of the provisions?\n\nWhen they increased money for gangrape in Uttar Pradesh, suddenly the number of complaints increased for the gangrape \u2014 all in similar areas. So these things happen \u2014 if you study about it.\n\nHow much was the compensation increased by?\n\nI don't remember exactly, you just compare the before and after numbers. I have observed that. When the Bulandshahr gangrape case happened \u2014 after that the number of cases increased in that area only.\n\n[Sharma could be referring to the gangrape of four women in Bulandshahr in May 2017. One man died while trying to resist the six armed assailants who also robbed them \u2014 Ed]\n\nIn another case, one member of the commission went and it was proven wrong. It was found that nothing like that had happened there.\n\nSo there are fake cases?\n\nThere are many fake cases. Around 30 percent of cases are fake. There is a property issue and they will include a line that a person has sexually abused me, touched me there.\n\n[HuffPost could not find any report on increase in compensation for gangrape victims specifically in UP. In May this year, the Supreme Court approved a scheme under which gangrape victims could be paid up to Rs 10lakh in compensation by the government \u2014 Ed]\n\nWhat are some of key priorities in your effort to tackle sexual violence in India?\n\nWe have to change the mindset. Whenever you see these rapes happen, somebody from this middle-class, lower-middle class person is involved. Because they are watching internet without any guidance, there is no parental guidance. From the age ten they start watching porn \u2014 we have to give them gender sensitization lessons, we have to do that first.\n\nActually not class, education. Where boys are not getting proper education, they don't have proper work and parental guidance \u2014 so class comes in that context that education is little.\n\nBut being educated doesn't mean a man won't sexually assault someone.\n\nOf course, a lot of sexual harassment happens at workplaces. But if you compare the number of cases, and the gruesome cases that you are seeing whether it is Nirbhaya or some other such case, there you see the difference.\n\nYes, sexual harassment at workplace is something educated people do.\n\nThere is a criticism against bodies like NCW and SCW that the people at the helm of these are political appointments with no real expertise or background of work in women's issues. How do you respond to that criticism?\n\nI was a part of an NGO for ten years. It started as a small thing, generating work for women in villages. I used to visit villages in Haryana for political purposes initially but there I realised that women didn't have money to feed their children also. It started to give them work -- making sevaiyaan -- and sell it to the stores, so that they can generate income.\n\nAt NCW, we did a survey of jails to find the state of women there. We also hosted legal awareness camps across various states. Recently, we tied up with Facebook to impart digital safety education to women in Panjab University. We are conducting a study on the condition of women in mental asylums... and my focus is to increase gender sensitivity among people.\n\nI have started from a district level. From there, I have come here. I have worked in a village called Ramgarh, in Panchkula. So grassroots starts from there.\n\n(We reached out to Thomson Reuters Foundation for clarity on their survey and they said they couldn't accommodate our request at the moment.)\n\n(Editor's note: A representative of the National Commission for Women called to clarify that the chairperson meant to say 30% of the rape cases NCW receives are 'false' when she was talking about 'fake' cases.)"

			"text": "Making the switch from conventional antiperspirants to natural deodorants can be a bit of an anxiety-inducing sweat session itself: no one wants to be stuck in a stinky situation! But after personally testing some of the top natural deodorants on the market, we can confidently tell you that a cleaner, more natural way to neutralize odour is a only roll, swipe, or spray away.\n\nBody chemistry seems to have an affect on which deodorant works best, so we'd suggest trying a couple and then hitting up your next hot yoga class or enduring a heat wave with confidence, armed with your favourites from our list!\n\nVapour\n\nWe instantly fell in love with the intoxicating scent of this handcrafted deodorant from organic beauty brand Vapour. A combination of plant and mineral ingredients combat odour and uplift the senses with a unique gel-to-powder formulation that lasts throughout the day.

A recycled bottle and non-aerosol pump are good for the earth, and the uplifting lemon-y scent combined with litsea cubeba essential oils naturally deodorizes for up to a full day of freshness.\n\nWeleda\n\nWe love the softly sweet blend of orange, vanilla and pomegranate in this travel-friendly roll-on also from Weleda.

In a meticulously planned ceremony to take place at St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor Castle at midday, Markle will arrive by car with her mother. She will walk part of the aisle alone before being joined by her soon-to-be father-in-law Prince Charles for the final stretch, after her own father pulled out at the last minute due to health problems. In details of the ceremony released overnight, the couple confirmed that their vows do not promise to \u201cobey\u201d, modern language has replaced the \u201cthee\u201d and \u201cthou\u201d of tradition, and their music choices have a heavy American influence, including Stand By Me and This Little Light of Mine performed by a gospel choir. And in a nod to the drama surrounding the uncertainty of Markle\u2019s fathers role in the ceremony, his name still appears on the order of service, which was printed days before he pulled out. It\u2019s been a turbulent few days for the couple, which follows a relationship that has blossomed mostly in the glare of intense media scrutiny. But it wasn\u2019t always the case. The couple were set up by a mutual female friend in 2016, and met on a blind date in London that summer. During their engagement interview in November 2017, Markle, who at the time was appearing in the US TV series Suits, admitted: \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about him.\u201d Markle said she asked her friend: \u201c\u2018I have one question\u2019, which was, \u2018Well, is he nice?\u2019 Because if he wasn\u2019t kind, it just didn\u2019t seem like it would make sense and so we went and we\u2026 met for a drink and I think very quickly into that we said, \u2018Well, what are we doing tomorrow?

So it\u2019s\u2026 we made it work.\u201d Harry revealed that he proposed during a cosy night at home over a roast chicken. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even let me finish, she said \u2018Can I say yes, can I say yes?\u2019 and then there were hugs.\u201d Markle recalled: \u201cJust a cosy night, it was \u2013 what we were doing just roasting chicken and having \u2026trying to roast a chicken and \u2026 just an amazing surprise. \u201cIt was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee.\u201d Harry added: \u201cThe fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly was sort of confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned, that everything was perfect.\u201d\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Markle's engagement ring was made using two diamonds from Diana, Princess of Wales' personal collection and a central diamond sourced from Botswana\n\nWith a new royal wedding on the cards, the couple were thrust firmly into the spotlight, and even Harry was shocked at the attention they began to receive. \u201cI tried\u2026 to warn you as much as possible but I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction after the first five, six months which we had to ourselves, of what actually happened from then,\u201d the prince said. Harry had earlier taken the extraordinary step of issuing a statement in which he made clear his distress over the media\u2019s treatment of her, with very strong language referring to the \u201dsexism\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d to which she has been subjected. In recent weeks the media attention has focused on Markle\u2019s father, Thomas, who appeared in pictures in a number of British newspapers which it later emerged were staged, prompting him to drop out of the wedding, telling celebrity news website TMZ that he did not want to \u201cembarrass the royal family or his daughter.\u201d Shortly afterwards, it looked as if the award-winning lighting director could still attend his daughter\u2019s nuptials, but it later emerged that doctors would not allow Mr Markle to leave hospital so soon after undergoing heart surgery on Wednesday. Much has also been made of the fact this will be Markle\u2019s second marriage, having married producer Trevor Engelson in September 2011 after dating him for six years. Their wedding took place in Jamaica and was celebrated with a barbecue on the beach. The couple split in May 2013.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images The Prince and his bride-to-be at their first official engagement together at a Terrence Higgins Trust World AIDS Day charity fair\n\nMarkle, who was a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and campaigns for gender equality through her work as a woman\u2019s advocate for the UN, has had to adjust her lifestyle in the run-up to becoming a royal. The lifestyle blog she ran focused around articles on self-empowerment and messages of positivity, in which she opened up about her life, loves, favourite foods and even her celebrity hairdresser, but it was closed down nine months after she started dating Harry, leaving fans the message: \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget your worth \u2013 as I\u2019ve told you time and time again: you, my sweet friend, you are enough.\u201d Markle has also left the series Suits and deleted her Twitter and Instagram accounts. Upon her marriage, she will become a full-time royal and start charitable interests afresh with Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as change,\u201d she said. As for whether the couple plan to have children, Harry said: \u201cOne step at a time and hopefully we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\u201d"

Ever since her appointment in January as the world\u2019s very first \u2018Minister for Loneliness\u2019, the 42-year-old British politician has been inundated with individual pleas for help and avid interest from governments around the globe. Crouch was given her new role by Prime Minister Theresa May, following a study that found that more than nine million Britons often or always feel lonely. But she rapidly realised the problem of social isolation is not unique to the UK, and the message sent to London was loud and clear: you are not alone when it comes to loneliness. \u201cThe reaction was phenomenal,\u201d she told HuffPost UK. \u201cWe got back to my Parliamentary office having done the morning media round and I literally found my secretary under the desk because the phone hadn\u2019t stopped ringing, the emails were going absolutely insane.

And then once it filtered through and went global, the reaction has been amazing.\u201d Speaking in her government office just yards from Westminster\u2019s Big Ben tower, Crouch was fresh from a meeting with Norwegian and Danish ministers who want to learn from the British initiative. \u201cA lot of people have come to see me. The Canada, UEA, Sweden, Japan, Iceland. I cannot think of a region in the world that didn\u2019t follow this up. Germany has been massively interested. We expected Europe, but a significant number of African countries are reporting on it as well. New Zealand said \u2018we are watching what you do\u2019, so no pressure there then!\u201d\n\nPA Archive/PA Images Tributes to Labour MP Jo Cox after she was murdered\n\nThe UK government decided to act after the publication earlier this year of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness, a detailed study into the scale and extent of the problem. Labour MP Cox, who had begun the work after she personally experienced loneliness following the birth of her first child, was brutally murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum campaign. The Commission set up in her name was intended as a lasting legacy of the power of politics to unite, rather than divide, communities. Its key recommendations included not just the creation of a specified Minister for Loneliness, but also more research and evidence-based work on how to find solutions to a problem that Prime Minister May said was \u201cfor far too many people\u2026the sad reality of modern life\u201d. Of the thousands of emails that Crouch has received since January, she says two really stuck out. \u201cThere was one from a young lady who was in her 30s who wrote to me to say she was a professional, she\u2019d moved to London as part of her job, a great job, but she was incredibly lonely because she gets up, she goes to work, and then when she gets back there\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of her friends and family are elsewhere in the country and she found it very difficult to make meaningful connections in a city which, although being vibrant and diverse, if you\u2019re quite shy and don\u2019t pop up into clubs or go into a bar like at home, it\u2019s difficult. \u201cAnother was a constituent who was an older gentleman who said that he had been a full-time carer for his wife, who had died quite a few years ago, but felt incredibly lonely. He didn\u2019t realise it was loneliness until he started to talk about it. The announcement helped him identify that he was lonely and he wanted to know if there were any projects locally that he could get involved in. \u201cI think one of the things the announcement has done is it made it clear there is a thing called loneliness and we should take it seriously. And it does have a public health impact.\u201d That impact is substantial, according to the limited research done to date. One US study suggested that the reduction in lifespan from loneliness was similar to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and even greater than obesity. Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote last year that as a doctor \u201cthe most common pathology I saw was not heart disease or diabetes; it was loneliness\u201d. Since the 1980s in Japan, the phenomenon of old people dying alone has even had a name: kodokushi. Another report, published this year by healthcare insurer Cigna and IpsosMORI pollsters, found that loneliness had reached \u201cepidemic levels\u201d in the United States. Nearly half of those surveyed said they sometimes or always felt lonely (46%) or left out (47%). One of the more striking findings in the Cigna study was that younger generations are more lonely that those who are middle aged, with the problem most acute among 18-22 year-olds. Millennials, aged 23 to 37, are more lonely than \u2018Baby Boomers\u2019, aged 52 to 71.\n\nDCMS The UK's Minister for Loneliness, Tracey Crouch\n\nThose figures tally with new numbers from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics released in April, Crouch points out. \u201cThey showed, completely contrary to what people assume, that younger people are more likely than older people to feel lonely. And although older people feature highly on the statistics scale, it\u2019s 16 to 24 year-olds that are more likely to feel lonely.\u201d One problem could be that social media isn\u2019t really that \u2018social\u2019 after all, the minister says. \u201cOne of the possible causes of loneliness, particularly among young people is the advent of digital connectivity. We have one of the most digitally connected generations and yet what we are seeing is an increase in loneliness. That is a potential link. \u201cWe have these challenges of what is real and what is virtual. And with the advent of social media people think that they\u2019ve got 200 friends on Instagram or Facebook but when they need real friends, they don\u2019t necessarily have that meaningful connection. \u201cA lot of work is being done on how we can build resilience within children to understand how you can have a healthy relationship with social media.\u201d She adds: \u201cThat digital connectivity could also be a solution, connecting older people to families that may be elsewhere in the world. Having that inter-generational link, so young people are teaching old people how to use computers. But also apps, developing services connecting people like young mums in their local area.\u201d\n\nMush The 'Mush' app for young parents\n\nCrouch praises one UK app, called \u2018Mush\u2019, which allows mothers of young children to build real-life social networks. And as the very first British Conservative minister to take maternity leave while in office, she is well aware that parenting can be a lonely business. Her son Freddie was born in 2016, at the height of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the European Union. \u201cAs new mum on maternity leave while the rest of Westminster was going crazy over Brexit, you can\u2019t help but feel it,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when you are surrounded by an amazing partner, brilliant family and friends, when they\u2019ve all gone off to work and you\u2019re suddenly left with a baby and nothing to do, it can be a bit isolating at times.\u201d Crouch, a qualified soccer coach and keen player, is also the UK\u2019s Sports Minister. So it was perhaps no surprise that her answer was to get outdoors. \u201cI dealt with it very simply. Obviously, I\u2019m keen on exercise and the power of exercise and I would put Freddie in the stroller and go for a walk, go to the supermarket, talk to the checkout girl, go home and feel much better.\u201d She stresses that her own loneliness was never \u201cacute\u201d, whereas her work is aimed at those for whom the condition becomes \u201cdebilitating\u201d, but it\u2019s clear she believes it\u2019s important to step in to prevent things getting that far. \u201cIt is right that people feel lonely on occasions, it\u2019s an important emotion to learn to be able to live with and to challenge. The problem is when it becomes an overwhelming emotion that is out of your control and that\u2019s the level we are looking at.\u201d Young parents are just one group who are a focus for the work done by Crouch\u2019s team of civil servants, drawn from 10 different government departments. \u201cWe are looking at which groups are most vulnerable, what the trigger points are, if there are any transitional points. If you take older people, bereavement might be a trigger point, becoming a full time carer can be too,\u201d Crouch says. She points to the pioneering work of a \u2018bereavement club\u2019 run by the Co-Operative Funeral Care chain. \u201cIn their reception, they have leaflets about peer support groups in their local area. I think they\u2019ve had two marriages from their bereavement club, which is amazing,\u201d she adds.\n\nHero Images via Getty Images University isolation is one possible 'trigger'\n\nFor the younger generation, the trigger point can be moving to a new area for work, or going to university. Crouch even hints that the introduction of tuition fees is a factor that could have led to more possible isolation. \u201cIn many respects since my day, university life has changed quite significantly. We used to go to university for a life-enhancing experience whereas now with tuition fees, university becomes a place where you go and you study and you leave. And so you don\u2019t necessarily make the same level of connections that we would have made. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is how does that stack up around the world? In America you\u2019ve always paid for your tuition, so is this a new phenomenon in the UK because of the increase in tuition fees, or is this something that happens in other countries? It\u2019s really difficult to say that would be a cause at this particular juncture without research.\u201d As a new Member of Parliament, Crouch took an early interest in the UK\u2019s Campaign To End Loneliness, which has been around for more than a decade. But she thinks the world is 10 years behind the curve and compares the battle to be heard with similar struggles to get mental health on the policy agenda. \u201cThe main thing is recognising the issue and breaking down the stigma around it. We are really at the start of a journey that perhaps mental health was at a decade ago. Mental health charities have done a phenomenal job in breaking down the stigma around talking about it, we are only at the beginning of that with loneliness. \u201cWe are working quite closely with a lot of mental health charities, although it\u2019s not necessarily the case that loneliness leads to a mental health condition, there may well be a link that if you don\u2019t step in at that early stage, will it have a causal effect to transferring to something greater, like depression or anxiety.\u201d\n\nPA Wire/PA Images UK Prime Minister Theresa May at a reception for the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission\n\nThe minister is candid too about the scale of the task ahead of her. \u201cI acknowledge the enormous privilege it is to be the world\u2019s first loneliness minister and to be really pioneering policy on this, and thinking about a lot of strategic things across the whole of government, local authorities, community organisations. \u201cAt the same time, I feel enormously overwhelmed by the challenge. Because there are so many different issues involved. There isn\u2019t one problem and therefore there isn\u2019t one solution. \u201cAnd it\u2019s subjective. It can be caused by a very personal incident at a particular time in somebody\u2019s life that perhaps at any other time it may not have occurred. You can\u2019t identify people who are lonely. \u201cYou cannot assume somebody who is living alone is lonely, in the same way that you can\u2019t assume somebody who is married with three children isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s one of the hardest challenges that we face. We are working with a lot of partners to try and help in that identification process.\u201d One of the causes of the loneliness epidemic is demographic, with young men and women delaying having children until much later than their parents and grandparents. The traditional route of leaving home to go straight to marriage is a rarity, and \u2018singletons\u2019 are on the rise. The EU has its highest ever number of single-person households. Crouch, who will sketch out her first answers to the problems in a new strategy to be published this autumn, hints that one solution would be to change the physical make-up of our town and cities. \u201cHave we accidentally built-in loneliness into communities? Through architecture, by building lots of gated communities to support single households, the fact that you need a keypad to get through the front door or you don\u2019t know who\u2019s in the apartment next to you, or there are no communal areas, have we inadvertently created problems?\u201d She\u2019s looking at research work in Vancouver on \u2018the built environment\u2019, but the US too has a history that others could learn from, she says.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman via Getty Images A 'chair yoga' session for residents of John Knox retirement village in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Florida, the well-known retirement state, you see from a UK perspective a very healthy, happy retirement state that has facilities to cater to their needs and desires. Is that something we should be thinking about here? Building more retirement villages?\u201d To counter the possible isolation faced by those living on their own and new to an area, apartment buildings with more communal kitchens and lounges are being trialled in the US and other countries. \u201cI was reading something recently about which parts of the day are most depressing for those who are living alone and presenting with loneliness issues and it\u2019s actually dinner,\u201d Crouch says. \u201cThat eating time when you are cooking by yourself and eating it on your knee watching the TV, because that\u2019s more soul-enhancing than sitting at the table by yourself which can be quite soul destroying - that is a really challenging point in somebody\u2019s day. \u201cThe other thing is that we quite often think of Christmas as a trigger point for people around loneliness, so rightly there are campaigns to make sure you check on your neighbours, knock on the door on Christmas Day and that\u2019s all fantastic. \u201cBut actually summer barbecue season is more likely to bring out feelings of loneliness, because you will walk past a park and see groups of friends having a picnic, or you can hear your neighbours four houses down having a good jolly time over a barbecue, and that\u2019s when you\u2019re kind of in a real experience of loneliness.\u201d Not all the visitors to Crouch\u2019s office are government ministers. American actress Goldie Hawn recently dropped by as part of her own work on helping young people cope with stress and anxiety.\n\nEnergizing meeting with the lovely @goldiehawn re the challenge of loneliness & the brilliant work of @MindUP4Success @MindUPUK pic.twitter.com/LGwuDbGsDZ \u2014 Tracey Crouch (@tracey_crouch) June 5, 2018\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing. We discussed how, starting at a young age with children, they can develop ways to deal with stress and anxiety, coping mechanisms, breathing mechanisms.\u201d And Hawn, now aged 72, is just one senior citizen who is helping youngsters build up the resilience they need to combat periods of loneliness. Crouch has been particularly impressed by \u2018inter-generational\u2019 care homes for the elderly that include children\u2019s kindergardens. \u201cIt\u2019s good for older people having youngsters around keeping them on their toes and their innocence and lack of prejudice, it\u2019s really good. But it\u2019s also healthy for the younger generation to have that grandparent or great-grandparent figure to be supporting them. \u201cThat\u2019s two extremes, but we are seeing the benefits in other ages. People like early retirees volunteering to read in primary schools, or helping in secondary schools with some of the pastoral care. So we are seeing a bit more of that and I\u2019d love to see more of it.\u201d Nursery and early-years care is one area where the UK government\u2019s critics have pointed out that all of the worthy work on combatting loneliness among young parents contrasts with cuts to funding of public services. SureStart children\u2019s centres, first set up by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government to offer free, Scandinavian-style support, have been closed or downsized across the country. Critics claim that young mothers have been left more isolated as a result. Although political opponents have united on the loneliness agenda, some of the left think the Conservative government has undermined the fabric of public services that are needed to help community cohesion. The left argue that rampant global capitalism has long promoted \u2018atomisation\u2019 rather than togetherness. The right say society is not the same as the state.\n\nJohn Stillwell - PA Images via Getty Images Tony Blair launches the first SureStart Children's Centre in London the 1990s\n\nCrouch is candid about the problems, and suggests one answer is to create \u2018impact assessments\u2019 for future public policy changes to gauge the possible effect on loneliness. \u201cThere is a recognition that there might have been unintended consequences of some decisions that have been made,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd actually one of the things I\u2019m looking at is whether or not we can start to use loneliness as a means of assessing policy before it is implemented. We already do that with gender and disability and other factors. So should we start to think about \u2018how does this policy impact on isolation?\u2019 \u201cOn transport, for example, we are bringing expertise around rural transport. If you axe a bus service, you do it for the right intentions but could it have an impact on isolation? \u201cIt may be that there is a recognition, it would have an impact, it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t go ahead but at least we\u2019ve acknowledged that it could have that impact. \u201cI\u2019m a realist about the politics of these things. But the other thing I will say is that loneliness didn\u2019t begin in 2010 [when David Cameron first became Prime Minister]. \u201cOne of the challenges that we face is how do we prevent it from happening in the future, starting from this position. We know it\u2019s been a phenomenon for some time but it\u2019s only now that we\u2019ve started to talk about it. What do we do for the next 25 years to stop it? \u201cThe other thing that I\u2019m realistic about is that I won\u2019t be the minister who takes all the glory for successfully meeting the outcomes that we will set out in the strategy, because this is something that is going to take decades to help solve.\u201d As for the specifics of the SureStart programme, Crouch says that while it is an\u201cimportant\u201d means of support, policy has to evolve too. \u201cI am a fan of some of the SureStart centres in my constituency and I think I\u2019ve seen SureStart cuts in my own patch. Actually in the way that things were being run, it was right to review those particular centres, but in others they have been quite successful. So I think it\u2019s about taking a sensible approach to SureStart. But I also think there are other ways of connecting mums together. \u201cThe one thing I would say about loneliness is that, a bit like mental health, it isn\u2019t prejudiced to people\u2019s circumstances. Obviously SureStart was designed very much to support low-income and deprived communities, [but] loneliness isn\u2019t necessarily more prevalent in those communities than in more affluent areas. \u201cSo the one thing I have learned in the six months I\u2019ve been doing this is it is too simplistic to look at it in that way, there are many shades of grey.\u201d\n\nMensSheds Woodworking at a MensShed project\n\nIn the past month, Crouch has managed to put some money where the government\u2019s mouth is, creating a \u00a320m fund to help provide concrete cash to support anti-loneliness initiatives launched by charities, community groups and others. She\u2019s a particular fan of \u2018MenSheds\u2019, a community group that gives men the chance to meet up and continue or resume hobbies like woodworking. Other projects include a \u2018Radio Club\u2019 in Birmingham, a weekly show that allows senior citizens to host \u2018phone-ins\u2019 to connect with people living on their own. \u201cCentral government is not going to solve this alone. It is just one part of the picture. Ultimately local authorities, businesses and charitable organisations have a role to play,\u201d she adds. Crouch is keen to praise projects run by private sector companies. The Costa Coffee chain has something called the Chatty Caf\u00e9, where they set aside a table in 250 of their stores at a particular time on a day of the week, and people can go and sit there, not necessarily know anyone and have a chat with whoever turns up. The Marks & Spencer retail store do something similar with their \u2018Frazzle Caf\u00e9\u2019, an idea that stemmed from a programme drafted by Ruby Wax, the US comedy actress who has long championed better mental health provision. Businesses also need to look at not just individual projects, but also their own staff, Crouch says. \u201cWith business, it\u2019s brilliant how many are involved in organisations helping to combat loneliness but the thing they absolutely need to do is look out for the welfare of their own employees. \u201cWhat I would really like to see within their employee wellbeing surveys are questions around loneliness. The Co-op, for example, are fantastic in terms of measuring loneliness among their staff. I\u2019d like to see that as a matter of course.\u201d What hasn\u2019t deterred Crouch is the complaint from some that a Minister for Loneliness sounds like one of the saddest titles for anyone in public life. From the Beatles\u2019 \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 (\u201call the lonely people..where do they all come from?\u201d) to Morrissey\u2019s \u2018Please Help The Cause Against Loneliness\u2019, doesn\u2019t her job just conjure up images of British melancholy? \u201cWhat I find is that it does have that connotation of a negative aspect to it. Last week I met the UAE\u2019s [United Arab Emirates] Minister for Happiness and Wellbeing. I think I\u2019d much prefer to be the Minister for Happiness and Wellbeing, because ultimately that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to achieve,\u201d she says.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images Former British Prime Minister David Cameron\n\n\u201cBut you will remember that when David Cameron and the coalition government came in [in 2010], they had a Happiness Index and the Fourth Estate [the news media] ripped it to shreds. \u201cSo, despite the fact that I think a Minister for Happiness is ultimately what I should be called, I don\u2019t think it would have been as well-received as a Minister for Loneliness has been. Because what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve identified loneliness as a condition and we\u2019ve had that global interest. They\u2019re saying \u2018we have loneliness, we need to understand what they are doing in the UK\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s not just the melancholy, but the very idea of a minister having any role at all that has been mocked by some. As others joked about Harry Potter-style ministries of magic, US late-night TV host Stephen Colbert riffed at length on what he saw as a \u201cvery British\u201d, bureaucratic answer to a societal problem. \u201cHow is it supposed to work?\u201d Colbert asked his audience, before affecting an upper-class English accent. \u201c\u2018The Ministry has reviewed your application and you\u2019re not lonely enough, I\u2019m afraid. Your application for affection has been denied\u2019.\u201d"

			"text": "I've become sucked into watching the World Cup games this year. I think my mind is starving for something to focus on that's not horrifying world news. But it's hard to ignore the many ways in which the event is, and always has been, incredibly gendered.\n\nWhile many are criticizing the sexual harassment and sexism pervasive at this year's World Cup, sexism in the world of sports (or anywhere) is nothing new at all. But seeing how the World Cup is currently in its throes, there's no time like the present to take a look at some of the many shocking ways in which this year's mega-event has truly crossed the line, including for sports journalists that are women.\n\nJulia Guimar\u00e3\n\nOn Sunday, Julia Guimar\u00e3es, a sports reporter for Brazil's TV Globo and sportv, had to scold a man who tried to kiss her during a live report in front of a stadium in Yekaterinburg before the Senegal-Japan match. She successfully ducked the idiot and proceeded to tell him off as her mic was cut. \"Don't do this,\" she said. \"I don't allow you to do this, never, OK? This is not polite. This is not right. Never do this. Never do this to a woman, OK? Respect.\"\n\nGreat response from Brazilian TV journalist Julia Guimaraes of Sportv to unacceptable behaviour. Not easy to show such restraint in the face of harassment. pic.twitter.com/eFVZz6gdMA \u2014 Colin Millar (@Millar_Colin) June 24, 2018\n\nGuimar\u00e3es later tweeted that it's \"hard to find words,\" and that similar incidents had also happened to her twice already in Russia, one of these at the Egypt-Uruguay game. \"It's awful. I feel helpless, vulnerable. This time I gave an answer, but it's sad, people do not understand. I wanted to understand why you think you have a right to do that,\" she said, according to a translation.\n\nJulieth Gonzalez Theran\n\nBerlin-based Colombian journalist Julieth Gonzalez Theran was groped and kissed during a live-air broadcast at the World Cup. It happened fast. As she was giving a live report from Moscow, a man appeared out of nowhere, grabbed her breast and kissed her on the cheek. She continued with her report, fully ignoring the guy, but later expressed her outrage on Instagram.\n\nClaudia Neumann\n\nClaudia Neumann is the first woman ever to narrate a men's World Cup game for German public broadcaster ZDF. Sadly, and unsurprisingly, Neumann has experienced a barrage of hatefully sexist online abuse and criticism from male fans.\n\nAt the start of this year's World Cup, she responded to the internet hate calmly. \"No, I do not care about it,\" she said, adding that the internet hate represents only a \"minority that receives a lot of attention.\"\n\nBurger King's \"controversial\" World Cup ad campaign\n\nYo, check out this: Burger King Russia's ad was honestly and truly offering money and free burgers to Russian women impregnated by Russian World Cup players. Unsurprisingly, it was removed after people, you know, reacted.\n\n\"Each will receive 3 million rubles [$47,000 USD],\" said the ad, \"and a lifelong supply of Whoppers. For these girls, it will be possible to get the best football genes and will lay down the success of the Russian national team on several generations ahead.\"\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether or not this next-level vile ad was a response to comments made by Russian politician Tamara Pletnyova, who urged Russian women not to have sex with foreign World Cup visitors, I'm calling multiple isms on this one either way. Burger King has since issued an apology, but, um, where to even start?\n\nGetty Images joins the party too, because why not\n\nIf I haven't sufficiently rained on your World Cup parade just yet, Getty Images posted a gallery of photographs titled \"World Cup 2018: The Sexiest Fans,\" comprised entirely of shots of (conventionally) attractive (and in most cases, scantily clad) women. They, of course, came under the gun after that for not feeding their straight women (or gay/bi men) viewers any eye candy whatsoever, and seemingly mocking the concept of women enjoying sports. Getty has since removed the gallery and issued a brief apology.\n\nBrazilian UN Women issues a statement\n\nThe many misogynist incidents at this year's World Cup are just the latest evidence that rape culture is thriving around the world, and knows no cultural bounds.\n\nDylan Martinez / Reuters A fan reacts after the match between Brazil and Mexico on July 2, 2018.\n\nIn addition to these incidents, a bombardment of Twitter posts showcasing sexist and harassing behaviours by Brazilian soccer fans in Russia actually prompted the Brazilian office of UN Women to issue a statement, decrying the \"deliberate intention of some Brazilian fans to sexually harass women during the World Cup.\"\n\nFor me, one silver-lined takeaway in all of this is social media. In many cases it has been a real outlet for targeted women reporters, and a powerful tool for rallying support and rightful indignation, as well as spreading awareness. Because what more can we really do than spread the good word and fight misogynist bullshit wherever and whenever possible?\n\nNSFW: This article was originally published on Bellesa.co\n\nHave you been affected personally by this or another issue?

We regret that our common work at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.\"\n\nLe Maire tweeted Tuesday that if the U.S. wants to \"renew its dialogue with its historical allies, it was up to them to take the first step and show willingness to co-operate with clear signs of de-escalation.\"\n\nCanada, which is hosting the meeting of the world's top liberal democracies in Charlevoix, Que., Friday and Saturday, refused to set conditions on the Americans' participation. Trump is still expected to attend the gathering, a senior government official said.\n\nAny musings about a G6 being more productive without the U.S. president would send the wrong message, another senior official said.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that we are going to make the G7 as productive as we can,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad, told HuffPost.\n\nThe forum's topics \u2014 economic growth and the future of work, gender equality, climate change and oceans protection, peace and security \u2014 were chosen as areas where common ground should be achievable.\n\nBut the trade dispute threatens to dominate the talks.\n\n\"There are going to be issues which we don't agree on, and that's always the case, but we are expecting to have frank discussions and good conversations about them,\" Ahmad simply said.\n\nWhile it is impossible for Trudeau to disinvite Trump, Fen Hampson, esteemed chancellor's professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs in Ottawa, said it would be a more productive session without him.\n\n\"You can't disinvite. But should Trump for whatever reason decide that he doesn't want to come \u2014 and he has a potential excuse with preparation for the upcoming meeting with the North Korean leader \u2014 I think it would be a much better meeting, because then those countries who are deeply affected from the trade war he has initiated could discuss strategy and how to maintain a common front.\"\n\nColin Robertson, vice-president and fellow at Canadian Global Affairs Institute, thinks it important to have the U.S. at the G7 so that it doesn't just look like a \"whine session.\" While the leaders' summit this Friday and Saturday may end up being a disaster, Robertson argues that the real value of having the U.S. on board is that they are involved in all the meetings leading up to the leaders' summit. \"It is sort of a continuity for the future.\"\n\nIn 2014, the major liberal democracies of the world threw Russia out of the G8, turning the elite club back into the G7. The forum of big industrialized nations, which has existed for more than 40 years, includes: Canada, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and, although not included in the tally, representatives from the European Union.\n\nKicking the United States out of the G7, however, would be a big move that could prove counterproductive.\n\n\"I think they [should] keep it the way it is and just hope for a president who will take a different view,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"The whole thing is about tying Gulliver down, and even though this Gulliver may not be for tying down, at least getting him in the room is important.\"\n\nWhile the G7's outcomes are usually based on consensus, the U.S. has been sidelined in other forums recently. At the OECD's ministerial council meeting last month, the chair noted that everyone had agreed on the importance of multilateralism as the most effective model to build peace and security, but one member, without naming the Americans.\n\nTrudeau rejects Trump's push for bilateral trade talks:\n\nWednesday, Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects the G7 talks to be \"contentious\" and hoped that the members would not \"keep watering down\" commitments just to get Trump onboard. \"There must not be a compromise simply for the sake of a compromise,\" Merkel said, according to an Associated Press report. Having Canada, as host, issue a final statement rather than a joint communiqu\u00e9 might be more honest, she said.\n\nIn Ottawa, Eva Ricarda Willems, the first secretary at the German embassy, stressed her country's firm commitment to a multilateral approach.\n\nIn a shared press release, Germany noted the U.S. decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs was a move universally condemned by its allies as a violation of international trade rules.\n\n\"The measure threatens to escalate into a downward spiral, which will ultimately be detrimental to everyone,\" Merkel's government said.\n\nEric Navel, France's communications counsellor at the embassy in Ottawa, noted his government's message championing strong multilateralism. French President Emmanuel Macron is in Canada's capital Wednesday for a two-day bilateral visit ahead of the summit. Macron and Trudeau have both tried to charm Trump to no avail. Macron did not get the outcome he wished in safeguarding the Iran deal, Trudeau is still waiting on Trump to finalize NAFTA talks.\n\n'They don't really want to kick the Americans out'\n\nA diplomat from one of the G7 countries who did not want to be identified because he didn't have clearance to speak with the media told HuffPost that there were a lot of other issues beyond trade, such as North Korea, that need to be discussed with the United States.\n\n\"Sometimes we don't agree on certain issues but it is important that G7 countries continue to engage, because we share fundamental values, like human rights and democracy, and so on. Of course, democracy is now challenged,\" he added with a nervous laugh. \"But we respect, the democratic system.\"\n\nAnother diplomat who did not want his country identified echoed the sentiment that the G7 is a long-standing alliance that can \"maturely address political differences\" in a full and frank manner.\n\nAn official with the Italian embassy in Ottawa, Francesco Corsaro, said his government is a strong G7 supporter. \"We want the G7 to stay G7.\"\n\n\"They don't really want to kick the Americans out,\" Hampson told HuffPost. \"It's the biggest economy in the world and the leader of the Western alliances. But when it is behaving badly, a time out isn't necessarily a bad thing.\""

We asked body language experts to analyze Ragland\u2019s behavior, posture and interactions with the royal family on the wedding day. The public got a first glimpse of the bride and her mother as they pulled up to the chapel together, a moment captured in the image below.\n\nOLI SCARFF via Getty Images Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, arrives at St. George's Chapel with her mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nBody language expert Traci Brown, author of Persuasion Point: Body Language and Speech for Influence, noted that Meghan and her mom have similar \u2015 though not identical \u2015 excited expressions on their faces. Meghan\u2019s smile appears more relaxed than her mother\u2019s, which makes sense because Ragland isn\u2019t as accustomed to being in the limelight. \u201cHer mom has her eyebrows raised and we can see more of the whites of her eyes. That says surprise,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI bet she\u2019s just a tad overwhelmed with the crowds and attention. It\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s not going to be quite as used to the attention as her daughter, who\u2019s spent the last year or so getting used to it. But she\u2019s done a good job of practicing her beauty queen wave!\u201d Many royal wedding viewers also took note of Ragland\u2019s interactions with Charles, who appeared to be going out of his way to make sure she felt comfortable and included.\n\nPrince Charles takes the hand of Doria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u2019s mother, as they move from the Quire for the signing of the registers. https://t.co/9c7Q1NnHMS #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/rKpXjT6AIF \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) May 19, 2018\n\nCase in point: In the video above, we see Charles take Ragland\u2019s hand as they leave to witness the signing of the marriage register. Joe Navarro, body language expert and author of What Every Body is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent\u2019s Guide to Speed-Reading People, called this a particularly \u201clovely moment.\u201d \u201cPrince Charles, who is not known for being touchy-feely even with his own children, made sure Markle\u2019s mother transitioned, hand-in-hand, with the entourage to the register,\u201d he said.\n\nOWEN HUMPHREYS via Getty Images Charles and Ragland exit St. George's Chapel together. They appeared to be chummy, despite having only met a couple of days prior.\n\nMark Bowden, body language expert and author of Truth and Lies: What People Are Really Thinking, said this royal wedding signifies not only the union of Harry and Meghan, but also that of their families \u2015 and even the union of the U.S. and the U.K. \u201cTherefore, the way the two sides interact with each other, from the couple\u2019s kiss to the physical placement and connection of family members with one another, has a bigger significance,\u201d Bowden said. As the royal family stood before the adoring public on the steps outside the chapel following the ceremony, Charles continued to show his warm support for Ragland.\n\nJANE BARLOW via Getty Images Charles walks arm-in-arm down the steps outside the chapel with both Ragland (left) and Camilla (right).\n\n\u201cThere is a saying in the U.K.: to be \u2018treated like a Duchess,\u2019 which means to be treated like royalty and given great service, respect and honor,\u201d Bowden said. \u201cPrince Charles shows Doria, the only family member present from the bride\u2019s side, exactly the same physical treatment as the duchess on his other arm.\u201d \u201cThough we could say this is just being polite, there is an etiquette in the royal circles which also bears huge weight and significance,\u201d he added.\n\nWPA Pool via Getty Images Ragland was all smiles after the emotional ceremony.\n\nBrown also noticed that Charles acted protective of Ragland, and that Ragland seemed to depend on him in return. \u201cWe always see her standing close with a hand on him,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s not used to the kind of hubbub they\u2019re all experiencing so we see her reach for the calming support.\u201d\n\nWPA Pool via Getty Images Throughout the day, Charles seemed to make an effort to make Ragland feel welcome.\n\nCharles frequently responded by resting a hand on Ragland and looking her in the eyes, as to give her his full attention. \u201cEven on Harry\u2019s way out of the church, we see the groom look back to check on the family, only to find that Charles is taking care of Meghan\u2019s mom,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBEN STANSALL via Getty Images Harry turns around to find his father Charles taking good care of Meghan's mom.\n\nAn unnamed royal staffer told Vogue last week that Ragland and the royal family \u201call got on extremely well\u201d during their pre-wedding sit-downs \u2015 a sentiment that Brown observed during the actual nuptials. \u201cThey\u2019ve really embraced her as part of the group, showing their full support and just how classy they are,\u201d she said.\n\nA post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on May 21, 2018 at 6:51am PDT"

He remained on the defensive, touting his company\u2019s idealistic vision.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) asked Zuckerberg if he would back legislation to mandate that digital platforms like Facebook obtain affirmative consent from users to collect their data for targeted advertising. Zuckerberg dodged: \u201cIn general, I think that principle is exactly right.\u201d\n\nWhen Sen.

Zuckerberg received numerous questions that revealed simple misunderstandings about what Facebook does and how it works. He answered questions about how the company makes money (\u201cWe sell ads\u201d), how much data it collects, whether it sells data, how targeted advertising works and whether it combines data from its many products. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the senators really understood how Facebook worked."

We talk to people about what they eat, how they exercise and generally, what their healthy lifestyle is to maintain their weight now that they've lost it. You can read more stories from Lost It here.\n\nBy: Oscar Chavez, as told to Chloe Tejada\n\nOccupation: Managing Partner and Founder of Health With Results\n\nAge: 32\n\nCity: Sydney, Australia\n\nThe story:\n\nI grew up big. I was always told by my mum to eat everything that was on my plate \u2014 even though it was adult-sized portions. Food is delicious!\n\nThe weight gain crept up on me. I had a bad break up in high school and I turned to food for comfort. Then I continued to turn to food when I had a bad day at work, when I was bored, when I just wanted to feel something. I was in massive denial about my state of happiness and contentment with my life.\n\nI tried everything in the 10 years I spent yo-yo dieting: meal replacement shakes, low calorie diets, low fat, low carb, meals delivered to my door, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and Tony Ferguson. I was desperate to change, especially when I finally faced the scale and saw that I weighed 354 pounds. I had massively let myself down.\n\nThe final straw:\n\nI was sitting in the doctor's office for a routine checkup and he told me that my blood pressure was through the roof. He told me that if I didn't change my bad habits I wouldn't live to see my kids' kids. That was my big wake-up call.\n\nHe suggested I have lap-band surgery to control my weight, but the prospect of surgery and all the complications that come with it scared me. I didn't want to give power to my condition by accepting surgery. Something in me said I had to fight for this naturally.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe plan of attack:\n\nI started researching food, nutrition, exercise and the human body. What was it that my body actually needed?\n\nIt's easy to be duped by marketing tactics, like all the low fat, zero-calorie labels, but that only contributes to temporary weight loss, meaning that the yo-yo spiral continues. There is a huge difference between temporary weight loss and permanent weight loss.\n\nThe inspiration:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was one of my biggest fitness inspirations. I watched a video where he was passionately obsessed with lifting and how he learnt to embrace the pain. So I took his philosophies with me into the gym with each work out and I had to become a completely different person, from someone who was lazy and made excuses to someone who took control of his own destiny.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Chavez (@fattofitfoodiecoach) on Jan 29, 2018 at 4:31pm PST\n\nThe hardest adjustment:\n\nI remember sitting there, looking at my gigantic portion sizes which I needed to eat to lose weight. Every time I tried dieting it was salads and starving. Now I had to shift to eating lots of whole food \u2014 past the point of being full.\n\nI had an existential moment where the very thing that led to my self-destruction was the only thing that could save me. I remember barely being able to breathe to eat the portions required. That was a crazy moment for me.\n\nThe food element:\n\nI started eating whole foods and I stopped relying on fast foods or heavily processed meals. I stopped being lazy and used the mindset, \"I'd rather die of starvation than put food in my body that would kill me.\" I took accountability. I turned to tacos as my go-to meal when I was time poor and pre-cooked chicken from the supermarket with a corn tortilla, some lime juice and yogurt.\n\nMy mantra is, \"Eat more and exercise less\" but you have to focus on quality. You need to know how much you're fuelling your body, just like when you fill up your car with petrol and go on a road trip. If you don't monitor the metre, then the car breaks down.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nCheck out more inspiring people:\n\nInspiring Lifestyle Success Stories Inspiring Lifestyle Success Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 270 Share this slide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI cut out things like chocolate bars, candy, chips, and crackers. I also cut out processed foods because they are calorie dense without the nutritional value so your body stores most of it as fat. These foods also damage your ability for your brain to tell you that you are full.\n\nI still have a problem with some types of food \u2014 I can eat forever so I just avoid them. So while I eat healthy most of the time, I still enjoy things like pizza and ice cream because I've focused on building a strong metabolism.\n\nThe exercise element:\n\nI joined a gym and I remained consistent. I worked with a couple of personal trainers, but in my experience some trainers aren't educated on what a morbidly obese frame can and can't do.\n\nI ended up slipping two disks in my spine due to improper technique with deadlifts that was never corrected by this trainer. I'm living with chronic pain because of it, but it doesn't stop me from working out and working on my health.\n\nBefore I decided to get healthy, my fitness level was horrible! I'd be huffing and puffing just from a walk up the stairs! I'd try to breathe quietly so that no one could hear me. Poor health has a detrimental effect on the overall quality of life, so that's why I like spreading my message. Life is just so much better when you're healthy.\n\nCurrently, I do high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and weight training. I work out six days a week, for 20- to 45-minute workouts. It's always changing. You have to constantly push yourself outside of your comfort zone and get slightly better every week.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe day-to-day:\n\nCurrently I wake up at 5:30 a.m., eat a big and nutritious breakfast and then go to the gym. I have a smoothie (frozen banana, blueberries, some nuts, and protein powder) after my work out then get ready for the day.\n\nI need at least seven hours of sleep a night. Sleep is necessary for peak performance. People think that by cutting out sleep they get more done but you are less productive during your awake hours due to fatigue.\n\nWhat I'm most proud of:\n\nLooking back, I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to do it without surgery. Weight loss is honestly a journey of personal growth. When you're obese, you kind of go to sleep in a way. You don't really see your own reflection in the mirror. You kind of look through yourself rather than at yourself.\n\nI spent many times in front of the mirror asking myself who I wanted to become and if I was going to let anything stand in my way. Many people put all their weight back on after a diet and for me, knowing what I know and how I felt, that's a sad fact.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe regret:\n\nI regret being asleep at the wheel of life for so long. The self-neglect has had detrimental effects on my health such as permanent back injury and lots of excess skin on my arms and stomach. It was hard to see my body changing. I believe that hardship develops character and I wouldn't be the person I am without going through all this hardship.\n\nThe advice:\n\nMy advice for people struggling with their weight is to stay away from temporary solutions. Ask yourself, can I continue this lifestyle forever? This means that low-carb foods, meal deliveries, weight loss shakes etc. don't work long term and in fact damage your metabolism, making you gain weight faster.\n\nI actually have a free online class to help people that are struggling.\n\nWhat I've learned since appearing on \"The Voice Australia\" Season 2:\n\nThat people are horrible! One person wrote on a YouTube video of my performance, \"Stupid Fat Family.\" I'd like to sit down for a cup of tea with that person and find out what makes them so bitter and resentful.\n\nOther than that, I've learned that life is what you make it and \"excuses\" are a construct developed to protect someone's ego. Excuses are the reason people don't get anywhere in life.\n\nThat being said ...\n\nI loved the whole \"The Voice\" experience and would go on it again. \"The Voice\" treats people with integrity unlike the other show that makes fun of people. All the people that went on my season are in a group together and we all chat from time to time. A wonderful, life changing experience that's for sure!\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

Please, be yes. A few weeks? A few months?\n\nTo get the answer we all want to know, The Huffington Post Australia spoke to two health experts -- dietitian and sports nutritionist Robbie Clark and trainer Daine McDonald.\n\n\"Physiologically speaking, to lose weight you must burn more calories (through physical activity) than you eat or drink,\" Clark told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"Basic body functions (breathing, nerve function, manufacturing cells, blood circulation and maintaining body temperature) use 50-70 percent of your calories or energy. The rate at which your body uses calories/energy for basic body functions at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR).\"\n\nGetty\n\nAdditional factors that strongly determine your BMR include your genes, age, gender and body composition.\n\n\"Therefore, much of your energy use is predetermined,\" Clark explained. \"However, the amount of energy you burn each day also depends on how much exercise you do (intensity, type and duration).\"\n\nOnce we consume more than our bodies need over a period of time, this then turns into weight gain.\n\nHow long it takes to lose weight\n\nWhile this depends on the individual as every person's body and goals are different to one another, if you begin to exercise three times a week and eat a healthy diet, you may find you lose weight quickly.\n\n\"There is no calculation for this as every individual is different and how their body responds to exercise will differ, as well,\" Clark said.\n\nIf an individual is significantly overweight and has more weight to lose than the average person who wants to lose five kilograms, they might lose more weight more quickly, Clark explained. However, this weight loss may be a combination of fluid loss and fat loss.\n\n\"For someone who has started exercising three times a week and eating a healthier diet, they may expect to lose one kilogram in 1\u00bd-2 weeks,\" he said. \"This is also dependant on the type of exercise they are performing and the duration and intensity of their training.\"\n\nLuis Alvarez The rate at which you lose weight depends on your exercise type and duration, as well as lifestyle choices and your overall health.\n\nMcDonald agrees, explaining that your 'training age' has a lot to do with how much weight you can lose.\n\n\"[Weight loss] really depends on where you are starting at in terms of your base level of physique. By that I mean what is your training age, which is the number of years you have trained for,\" McDonald told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"An example might be if you had not trained in years and put on 20 kilograms of weight, in particular around the midsection. Once you got into a routine of training, say four times per week and living by the 80/20 rule with your nutrition (80 percent good food and 20 percent bad), no doubt you would see a noticeable shift by the end of the first fortnight by potentially a few kilograms.\"\n\nFor someone who is new to training and doing 3-4 sessions per week while eating correctly, you can expect to lose anywhere between 0.5-2kg per week, depending on just how much weight they need to lose.\n\nHowever, if you had been already training three times per week and eating well, and decided to ramp it up to 5-6 exercise sessions per week and refine your food, then you may find a much smaller amount of results.\n\n\"There is no magic formula when it comes to predicting weight or fat loss,\" McDonald said. \"In saying that, from experience, for someone who is new to training and doing 3-4 sessions per week while eating correctly, you can expect to lose anywhere between 0.5-2 kilograms per week, depending on just how much weight they need to lose.\n\n\"The main things to remember are that, if you are serious about results, you want to train four times per week ideally and follow the 80/20 rule above. This alone should make a different to your body composition and overall health.\"\n\nWhy it's harder to lose weight than to gain it\n\nAs we all know, it's much easier to gain weight than it is to lose it. While this is primarily due to habit (if we're used to eating cake every day, it's ridiculously hard to stop), according to Clark and McDonald, there are a few other reasons why it can be difficult to shift weight.\n\nLifestyle choices\n\n\"I think it's important to note that the biology of weight loss and weight maintenance is a complex process,\" Clark explained. \"There are so many factors that contribute to overweight and obesity such as diet, inactivity, genetics, smoking, motivation, alcohol consumption, stress, poor sleep hygiene, occupation, environment and hormone imbalance, to name a few.\"\n\nBrand New Images We can't underestimate the power of sleep for our mental and physical health.\n\nUnderlying health issues\n\n\"If you are struggling to lose weight, it's important to rule out any underlying causes first and foremost,\" Clark said. \"There could be a medical reason for your struggle such as a chronic health condition like cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes, or a hormone imbalance such as your thyroid, sex hormones, insulin or cortisol.\"\n\nStress\n\n\"In today's world I believe the biggest factor that influences weight gain is stress, both physiological and psychological,\" McDonald told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"When your stress hormones such as cortisol are elevated in your body for prolonged periods of time it limits your body's ability to burn body fat, so when you factor in work stress, family stress, training stress, financial stress and so on, people end up being in an overly stressed and exhausted state.\n\n\"Over time this can lead to a large build up of visceral fat, which can be hard to shake.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Mindfulness or meditation can do wonder for stress levels (and you don't need to go to a fancy retreat do practise).\n\nDieting and ageing\n\nAlthough dieting can be a tempting method of quickly losing weight, Clark said the negative effects of dieting far outweigh the positive.\n\n\"Other factors that contribute to difficulties losing weight include regular yo-yo dieting, mindless eating, sedentary lifestyle and slowing metabolism that comes with age,\" Clark said.\n\n\"These factors predominately influence your hormone function, which plays a major role in your body's ability to lose weight.\n\n\"For example, weight cycling or yo-yo dieting can change your physiology. A reason for this is that through constant dieting your hunger hormone (ghrelin) increases and your fullness hormone (leptin) decreases. As a result, you will feel hungrier and less satiated every time you eat.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Fill up on these goodies instead of restricting.\n\nHow to lose weight in a healthy, sustainable way\n\nIn order to lose weight safely and in a way that you will actually be able to follow for more than a week, Clark and McDonald recommend the following.\n\n1. Be realistic with your weight loss goals\n\n\"A guide to follow for safe and sustainable weight loss is to aim for 0.5\u20131 kilogram per week. In order to lose one kilogram per week, you would need to burn and reduce your dietary intake by approximately 1,000 calories per day,\" Clark said.\n\nIf you're thinking 1,000 calories per day is completely unachievable, it equates to a one hour HIIT session (around 800 calories) and eating one less snack (around 200 calories).\n\n\"Having said this, it is also important that you create as much food variety as possible so you don't put yourself at risk of malnutrition or nutrient deficiencies.\"\n\n2. Avoid dieting and skipping meals\n\nNot only is skipping meals bad for your mood, energy levels and overall health, but it can also affect the way you eat later on.\n\n\"If you do skip meals, you are more likely to eat more when you do eat, and this may lead to a larger stomach capacity,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Crash dieting is a short term solution that will increase your body fat levels in the long term due to your body lowering its metabolic rate as a result.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Getting up and moving is addictive once you get into the rhythm and routine.\n\n3. Exercise regularly\n\n\"Train four times per week for 45-60 minutes per workout,\" McDonald said. \"While three times per week is good, four times per week is much better.\"\n\nFor best results, Clark recommends doing a combination of resistance (weight) training and cardiovascular training.\n\n\"Think of strength training as the main course at a restaurant -- cardio and yoga are all the equivalent of an entr\u00e9e. So strength training is the foundation of health and fitness,\" McDonald added.\n\n\"To stay in shape you need to teach your body to be healthy -- by being consistent with your training and nutrition week in and week out.\"\n\n4. Cut down on the refined carbs\n\n\"Refined carbohydrates such as cake, biscuits, cookies, muffins, chips, cupcakes, soft drink, fruit juice and most supermarket breads will make you store fat if not burned off,\" Clark explained.\n\n5. Watch your portions\n\n\"Be cautious of portion size of main meals and snacks -- always eat to 80 percent full before returning for seconds,\" Clark said.\n\n6. Avoid drinking your calories\n\n\"Don't drink your calories -- avoid beverages that contain 'empty' calories and don't fill you up such as soft drinks, large fruit juices and energy drinks,\" Clark said.\n\n7. It's never too late to start (or to try again)\n\n\"Health is in the mind, so remember you are never too late to start and it is never too late to rekindle your passion for health and fitness,\" McDonald said.\n\nFollow us on Snapchat!"

North Korea experts, however, called the agreement \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cold news\u201d \u2014 and pointed out that it falls short of goals the U.S. outlined prior to the Singapore summit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on Monday that the \u201ccomplete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept\u201d from Pyongyang. Tuesday\u2019s agreement included a commitment by Kim to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean peninsula, but the terms \u201cverifiable\u201d and \u201cirreversible\u201d were conspicuously absent from the document. It failed to explicitly define the scope of denuclearization, and didn\u2019t outline how North Korea might go about achieving it. Speaking to reporters a few hours after the signing ceremony, Trump said the two world leaders had agreed to engage in \u201cvigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible,\u201d though he provided no timetable for future talks. When pressed to explain what exactly \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d means, Trump said only that the process would be done as \u201cfast as can be done scientifically [and] mechanically.\u201d\n\nQ: What timetable do you envision for denuclearization and ease of any sanctions?\n\n\n\nTrump: Scientifically you have to wait certain periods of time...Sanctions will come off when we are sure the nukes are no longer effective. #TrumpKimSummit #tictocnews pic.twitter.com/XpXG6Xs7a4 \u2014 TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) June 12, 2018\n\nMintaro Oba, a former State Department expert on the Koreas, characterized the summit agreement as a \u201cwarm and fuzzy pile of generalities and old news.\u201d \u201cThe statement contained positions that are already well-established (like North Korean commitment to denuclearization \u2018of the Korean Peninsula,\u2019 and desire to work toward a \u2018peace regime\u2019 on the peninsula),\u201d Oba told HuffPost in an email, referring to similar promises made by Kim in April during his landmark meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Vipin Narang, an MIT professor of international relations, noted that the language in Tuesday\u2019s agreement bears striking similarities to a U.S.-North Korea declaration from 1993. \u201cRemember when they remade the movie Karate Kid 25 years later? That\u2019s what this is,\u201d Narang wrote on Twitter. Oba said the outcome was, however, \u201clargely expected given the complexity of these issues and the seriousness of North Korea\u2019s interest in maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent.\u201d He added that he would be keenly interested in whether follow-up talks led by Pompeo will lead to \u201csustainable, longer-term diplomatic\u201d ties between the two nations. Pompeo said on Monday that the United States had been \u201cfooled before\u201d by Pyongyang. \u201cMany presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper, only to find that the North Koreans either didn\u2019t promise what we thought they had or actually reneged on their promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018V\u2019 matters,\u201d Pompeo continued, referring to verification. \u201cWe are going to ensure that we set up a system sufficiently robust that we\u2019re able to verify these outcomes.\u201d Asked at Tuesday\u2019s press conference about the \u201cV\u201d word, Trump insisted that North Korea\u2019s denuclearization efforts \u201cwill be verified.\u201d When quizzed on how that would be accomplished, however, Trump replied that it would be \u201cachieved by having a lot of people there ... combinations of both\u201d American officials and international representatives.\n\n.@MajorCBS: Did you discuss methods to verify the process of denuclearization?\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cYes, we did \u2026 it will be achieved by having a lot of people there and as we develop a certain trust. And we think we have done that.\u201d https://t.co/0GKdLYDYlc pic.twitter.com/Iu8M4iQoce \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) June 12, 2018\n\nThe president added that some things had been agreed to after the deal was signed because there hadn\u2019t been \u201cenough time\u201d during the summit. He said, for instance, that Kim had promised to destroy a \u201cmajor\u201d missile testing site. He did not elaborate. Satellite imagery published last week by 38 North, a website devoted to North Korea analysis, indicating that the country had razed a \u201ckey missile test stand.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if this is what Trump was referring to. Trump said the U.S. had agreed to stop playing \u201cwar games\u201d with Pyongyang, referring to the joint military exercises with South Korea that Kim has condemned in the past. He added that he wants to \u201cbring our soldiers back home\u201d from South Korea, but said troop withdrawal was \u201cnot part of the equation right now.\u201d Some commentators skewered the president for what they called a \u201cvague\u201d agreement.\n\nNo verifiability provisions. No inspection provisions. Trump seems to have offered troop reductions and a freeze in military exercises. Details fuzzy -- but any US President other than Trump would be excoriated by both parties for such a weak, vague agreement #NorthKoreaSummit \u2014 Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) June 12, 2018\n\nThe more Trump talks about the deal, the worse it sounds. U.S. stops exercises, pledges to remove troops, no new sanctions, all in exchange for vague promises of denuclearization. #trumpkim \u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump says he\u2019s so different from past presidents. But he just signed a vague agreement with North Korea that talks about denuclearization with no real assurance they will ever do it. Sounds like Clinton and Bush to me. \u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump boasted that this agreement far exceeded skeptics' expectations. What we've seen so far is precisely the kind of vague and commitment-free agreement that skeptics expected. (Though some still believe the diplomacy itself is worthwhile.) \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) June 12, 2018\n\nTrump has abandoned American preparedness in exchange for vague North Korean promises, that have been broken before, and no secure means of verification. History & preparation matter. https://t.co/XYwW3KUJxi \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) June 12, 2018\n\nSome also pointed out that three of the four points outlined in the memorandum echoed Kim\u2019s agenda for the meeting, as outlined by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency prior to the summit.\n\nWhat KCNA said Kim Jong Un wanted.....and what he got.

He told customers and staff to get to the back of the restaurant, but as he was trying to pull the shutters down to protect them, he found himself face-to-face with two of the three attackers, who ended up killing eight people that night. \u201cI went to get the keys to get the shutter down immediately. I looked to my right and I saw two terrorists standing on the doorstep there. Just looking at me. I\u2019ll never forget that image, I just thought \u2018Shit, I\u2019m done\u2019. \u201cThere was so much hate in their eyes, blank hatred. It was like they were on a path to destruction.\u201d Just moments before, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30 and Youssef Zaghba, 22, had ploughed a white van into pedestrians on London Bridge, and then ran through to Borough Market, on the southern side of the embankment, stabbing Saturday night revellers with 12-inch ceramic knives. The three men, who were later revealed to have been pumped up on steroids during the attack, were shot and killed eight minutes after the police were called to the scene. It was over in a quick but devastating flash.\n\nHuffPost UK Restaurant owner Jack Applebee says the market has come out 'bigger and stronger' since the attacks\n\nAfter locking eyes with Applebee the men ran on. Police think it was because the people gathered in the restaurant had formed too large a group to target \u2013 allowing the restauranteur to pull the shutters down to the mayhem unfolding on the street. Several people armed themselves with kitchen knives for fear of the men returning, while staff handed out wine to try and calm their nerves. \u201cYeah, pour that down, mate,\u201d Applebee remembers them saying. \u201c[The staff] were really trying to make it as light-hearted as they could.\u201d As they calmed customers on the upper and lower floors of the restaurant, gun shots rang out from outside. \u201cWe thought it was a war going on, it was bonkers,\u201d he said. In the year since the attack, which saw Christine Archibald, 30, Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, lose their lives, Applebee says the experience has drawn the people from the local area \u201ctogether as a family.\u201d \u201cFortunately for us, no one here was harmed. We were some of the lucky ones.\u201d In the weeks after the attack, a giant makeshift memorial to the dead grew at the foot of the bridge - with hundreds of flowers piling up on the pavement from Londoners, many of whom drink Borough\u2019s bars, or commute through the busy railway station. Applebee said just one of the lasting effects of the tragedy is an increased police presence. \u201cThere are so many police around here, undercover and not, to make sure that these kind of events don\u2019t happen again. Which is very positive, it certainly makes you feel a lot better.\u201d\n\nDan Kitwood via Getty Images Police officers clearing the area near Borough Market on the night of the attacks\n\nPA The victims: Christine Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas and Ignacio Echeverria\n\nThe London Bridge attack came in a summer that had already been marred by tragedy. Attack in Westminster and Manchester, as well as the bombing of a Tube train at Parsons Green in London, and a van attack on pedestrians outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, had taken their toll. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, responded by vowing to clamp down on hate preaching and the spread of extremist ideology online. She also promised to review the powers held by police and security agencies, suggesting that jail sentences for extremism-linked crime could also be lengthened. But when news of London Bridge began to break on Saturday June 3, it reignited yet again the question of how to police such a large city from the threat of terror. In December the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, told the Cabinet a total of nine Islamist terrorist plots had been thwarted in the UK over the past year. Bollards have now been installed on bridges across the capital, to help halt car attacks like the ones on London and Westminter bridges in 2017. But PC Tom Hussey, who works with on the City of London\u2019s Project Servator, which deploys hundreds of specially-trained officers across London to areas that could be targeted by a terror attack, says the public also needs to play an active role. The UK\u2019s terror threat level remains at \u201csevere\u201d, Hussey said Londoners need to be the eyes and ears of the capital. \u201cAny little piece of information is valuable and no matter how unimportant somebody may see that information, it may be the piece of the puzzle that we are missing to stop a terrorist attack,\u201d he said. On Sunday, a minute\u2019s silence will be held at 4.30pm to mark a year since the terrorist atrocities in London Bridge and Borough Market.\n\nDay of joint working @MPSSouthwark & @CityPolice #ProjectServator teams at a vehicle check point on London Bridge.

			"text": "I vividly remember the first time I was taught about menstruation at school. Girls and boys were separated. We girls learned about menstrual health and hygiene with female teachers, while male teachers taught boys about topics that were never revealed to us.\n\nBy learning about the human body and menstruation in isolation, a barrier was established between boys and girls, conditioning all of us to believe that menstruation was not something we could talk about openly. This ordinary school day set the tone for a lifetime of stigma, cultural taboos and misinformation about menstruation.\n\nBecause so many of us learn these taboos at such a young age, the fact that we don't talk openly about periods starts to seem normal.\n\nBut it isn't.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\nPeriods are a fact of life, and the code of silence that surrounds them carries a heavier toll than you might expect. It can cause emotional anxiety and social isolation that can affect women and girls' physical, emotional and mental health, and their participation in society.\n\nGrowing up, my male peers often failed to understand the impact when they made comments like \"she's just PMSing\" or removed themselves from conversations that referenced \"periods.\" I began menstruating at an early age, before it was addressed in school. I remember not having a place to dispose of feminine hygiene products in my school's bathrooms. Barriers like these reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and prevent women and girls from practicing menstrual hygiene safely.\n\nPlan International Canada\n\nA recent survey conducted by Plan International Canada suggests that I'm far from alone in these experiences: 74 per cent of women under 25 reported having had other people accuse them of PMS. A shocking 83 per cent of women under 25 reported feeling that their period prevents them from full participation in an activity.\n\nAbove and beyond the social effects of period stigma, periods can also pose serious economic challenges for girls and women. According to the same survey, one third of women under 25 in Canada have struggled to afford menstrual products for themselves or their dependents.\n\nPeriod poverty \u2014 an inability to afford menstrual hygiene products or access appropriate facilities for menstrual hygiene management \u2014 is a real, often devastating, issue faced by women worldwide. UNICEF estimates that at least 500 million women and girls around the world lack the means to manage their monthly periods. Without access to appropriate supplies and facilities, girls are often unable to attend school while they have their periods, and women struggle to participate in their daily activities.\n\nGovernments, institutions and communities must recognize their roles in prioritizing menstrual hygiene\n\nWe're seeing strides in the right direction here in Canada and around the world, with initiatives like Centennial College's recent \"Free the Tampon\" project,which makes pads and tampons freely available.\n\nIn Uganda, Plan International is driving an innovative program through which girls and boys make reusable cloth sanitary napkins at school. This provides an entry point for menstruation education and creates a source of free hygiene products so girls can continue to attend school.\n\nGlobally, we need better leadership on this issue. If those in power are not people who menstruate, and shame or taboos keep us from talking about periods openly, how will we ever prioritize women's health issues? Governments, institutions and communities must recognize their roles in prioritizing menstrual hygiene to begin these critical conversations and destigmatize periods.\n\nThis Menstrual Hygiene Day, let's bring periods to the start of the conversation. Let's challenge everyone \u2014 boys, girls, men, women, communities, institutions, corporations and governments \u2014 to start talking about periods, innovating on women's health issues and consulting women and girls on how to break down harmful barriers when it comes to menstrual health. Only when we work together will we be able to find true solutions, and take steps to eliminate inequality.\n\nAmy Bing is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying International Relations and Political Science.

This causes the muscle to shorten and seize up, which in some cases can be painful.\"\n\nA commonly thought reason for muscle cramps is a lack of certain nutrients. While this is true, there are also various other reasons that can cause these often unbearable muscle cramps.\n\nPrevention is always the cure. Make sure you stay well hydrated and implement good nutrition and hydration protocols around training and heavy exercise.\n\n\"It is true that muscle tissue relies, in part, on a range of minerals, electrolytes and other chemicals in order to contract and relax,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Some of these important substances include calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. Poor diet, dehydration, vomiting and diarrhoea may disturb the body's balance of minerals and electrolytes and as a result, make muscles more susceptible to cramping.\"\n\nOther reasons why muscle cramps may occur include:\n\nMuscle fatigue or injury\n\nInadequate blood supply to the muscle (narrowing of the arteries) e.g. atherosclerosis\n\nNerve compression\n\nUse of diuretics and other medications\n\nMetabolic disorders\n\nNeuron disorders\n\nPoor muscle tone\n\nPoor gastrointestinal absorption (IBS, coeliac disease, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)\n\nTight or inflexible muscles\n\nExcessive sweating\n\nPhysical exertion of cold muscles\n\nAccording to Clark, maintaining proper nutrition may help reduce muscle cramps.\n\n\"Prevention is always the cure. Make sure you stay well hydrated and implement good nutrition and hydration protocols around training and heavy exercise,\" he said.\n\nGetty Images Drinking enough water can help to keep those pesky muscle cramps away.\n\n\"Optimise gut health to guarantee good absorption of the important nutrients involved in muscle function.\n\n\"Avoid restrictive diets and if you feel you are not getting all the nutrients your body requires, a dietitian can help to optimise your diet and food intake.\"\n\nWhen it comes to diet and foods that can help prevent muscle cramps, Clark said it's important to consume a variety of foods which are high in the following nutrients.\n\nSodium\n\n\"Your body requires sodium to maintain normal body-fluid balance and blood pressure. Sodium also works together with other electrolytes for nerve impulse generation and muscle contraction,\" Clark told HuffPost Australia.\n\nSteve Cicero Pickled foods are a good source of sodium, just don't go overboard.\n\n\"Be sure to get your sodium from unprocessed foods or natural sea or Himalayan rock salt. Some food sources containing sodium include pickled foods, cheese (cottage, feta, blue, cheddar, edam), beetroot, celery, carrots, pesto, smoked meats and fish, sauerkraut and olives.\"\n\nPotassium\n\n\"Potassium is the major electrolyte found inside all body cells and is critical for proper nervous system and muscular function, particularly for generation of electrical impulses, which is why your muscles can cramp if you're deficient.\"\n\nFood sources containing potassium include fruits (especially melons, citrus, bananas, avocados), vegetables (especially potatoes, sweet potato, pumpkin), dairy and fish.\n\nCalcium\n\n\"Calcium plays a crucial role in skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, including in your heart, blood vessels and intestines. It also plays a role in nerve impulse generation, so calcium deficiency may contribute to impaired muscle contraction,\" Clark told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"Food sources containing calcium include dairy, canned fish with edible bones (sardines, anchovies, pink salmon), dark, leafy greens, nuts and seeds and fortified tofu.\"\n\nGetty Images Yoghurt with banana is a good combination of potassium, calcium and magnesium to help with muscle cramps.\n\nMagnesium\n\nAbout one third of the magnesium in our body is located in our muscles where it is used for muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\n\"It also plays a crucial role in energy production, protein synthesis, nerve conduction and electrolyte balance,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Foods containing magnesium include legumes and soybeans, mackerel, avocado, nuts and seeds, dark, leafy greens, bananas, whole grains (brown rice, cereal), raw cocoa, dark chocolate, dried fruit and natural yoghurt.\"\n\nIf you do find yourself in the midst of a muscle cramp, Clark suggests the following actions.\n\nkwanchaichaiudom via Getty Images\n\n1. Stretch -- Engage in light stretches that are focused around the major and minor muscle groups that are cramping. A physio or exercise physiologist can help guide you on the best stretches.\n\n2. Hydrate -- Remain well hydrated so your body and muscles remain in fluid balance.\n\n3. Massage -- Lengthening the cramping muscle by using gentle massage may help reduce the duration and severity of the cramp.\n\n4. Ice pack -- In cases of severe cramps, an ice pack applied to the muscle for a few minutes may help.\n\n5. Medical -- See your GP or physio if you experience regular muscle cramping or if cramps last longer than a few minutes, as there may be an underlying medical condition that requires treatment."

In addition to the rescues, residents were able to walk against the current down a long road which is seen in the image. At first I went out on a boat with a couple from Louisiana to help and document several rescues. When we got back, I looked down the road and saw an almost perfect line of residents making the long walk to the staging area.

I wanted to communicate that it was a never-ending line of residents struggling to get to safety and it would go on for days. Harvey was a very difficult and emotionally taxing assignment.

But that doesn\u2019t mean you should necessarily let your guard down quickly.\n\nOral isn\u2019t entirely risk-free; it\u2019s still entirely possible to get a sexually transmitted infection. In fact, you can orally transmit most STIs, said Dr. Ryan Berglund, a urologist and men\u2019s health expert at Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\u201cThe most concerning virus is the human papillomavirus which causes genital warts, but has also been linked to cervical, penile, anal and head and neck cancers,\u201d he said. Roughly 76 million Americans have the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is often symptomless and usually goes away on its own in people under age 30 but can, in rare instances, lead to those more concerning health problems.\n\nOther infections you can pick up via oral sex are \u201cherpes, HIV, trichomoniasis, hepatitis A, B and C,\u201d said Sunny Rodgers, a Los Angeles-based clinical sexologist and ambassador for the American Sexual Health Association. \u201cAdditionally, it is also possible to contract genital warts and pubic lice.\n\nSTIs are often invisible\n\nSTIs can be symptomless, so you might not notice any infection-related problems in a partner before performing or receiving oral sex. This is the same reason why most sexual health educators have moved away from using \u201csexually transmitted disease\u201d (or STDs) to the more appropriate term \u201csexually transmitted infection.\u201d While they are one and the same, the \u201cdisease\u201d is misleading, Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cDisease insinuates a medical problem that will have an apparent sign or symptom,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people infected with common STDs are symptomless, or display mild symptoms, so the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria could be more appropriately described as an infection.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 10 percent of men and five to 30 percent of women with chlamydia show symptoms. Some estimates suggest that more than 90 percent of those with genital herpes will never be diagnosed; the red, painful sores associated with the condition can actually be mistaken for simple pimples or ingrown hairs. Gonorrhea is most common among women ages 15 to 24, and can be spread while symptomless. And if you do have symptoms, they might be mild, like vaginal discharge or burning during urination.\n\nThe invisible nature of most infections is why you need to get tested. Of course, if you or a partner notices sores, changes in urination, pain in the genitals or other abnormal symptoms, visit your doctor. But getting an STI test regardless of symptoms is also highly recommended, said Dr. Christine Greves, a board-certified ob/gyn and women\u2019s health expert at Orlando Health in Florida.\n\n\u201cThe only way to prevent an STI is to abstain,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are ways of lowering risk using different barriers, but I recommend getting regularly tested to all my female patients and their partners.\u201d\n\nYour doctor can advise you on the best course of action if you have an STI. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. Antivirals can shorten or decrease outbreaks of herpes, and nitroimidazoles can be prescribed to reduce your risk of transmission and shorten symptoms of trichomoniasis.\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself during oral sex\n\nFirst and foremost, get tested and get treatment before engaging in sex of any kind \u2015 including oral sex. If you notice an abnormal lesion on your partner\u2019s genitals, don\u2019t engage in oral. \u201cThe presence of active disease or sores on the genitals or mouth of either party will increase the risk of transmission,\u201d Berglund said. See your doctor, finish the entire course of treatment and listen to medical advice before you have sex.\n\nBarriers can also lower your risk of contracting or passing an STI. \u201cCondoms and dental dams, which are thin sheets of latex, can be used during oral sex,\u201d Rodgers said. A dental dam is applied over the vaginal opening; in a pinch, a condom can be fashioned into a dental dam and you can also use water-based lube for more sensation.\n\nThere are also other ways you can physically connect with your partner that are risk-free or lower risk. Other sexual activities that lower the possibility of spreading an STI are kissing, fondling, masturbation or mutual masturbation, Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cRealistically, there is no such thing as 100 percent safe sex, but rather safer sex with regular STI testing and the use of precautionary measures,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThe more knowledge a person has, the better.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t skip steps when it comes to your health, sexual or otherwise. Get educated, get tested and then get it on."

But that doesn't mean you should necessarily let your guard down quickly.\n\nOral isn't entirely risk-free; it's still entirely possible to get a sexually transmitted infection. In fact, you can orally transmit most STIs, said Dr. Ryan Berglund, a urologist and men's health expert at Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\"The most concerning virus is the human papillomavirus which causes genital warts, but has also been linked to cervical, penile, anal and head and neck cancers,\" he said. Roughly 76 million Americans have the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is often symptomless and usually goes away on its own in people under age 30 but can, in rare instances, lead to those more concerning health problems.\n\nOther infections you can pick up via oral sex are \"herpes, HIV, trichomoniasis, hepatitis A, B and C,\" said Sunny Rodgers, a Los Angeles-based clinical sexologist and ambassador for the American Sexual Health Association. \"Additionally, it is also possible to contract genital warts and pubic lice.\n\nSTIs are often invisible\n\nSTIs can be symptomless, so you might not notice any infection-related problems in a partner before performing or receiving oral sex. This is the same reason why most sexual health educators have moved away from using \"sexually transmitted disease\" (or STDs) to the more appropriate term \"sexually transmitted infection.\" While they are one and the same, the \"disease\" is misleading, Rodgers said.\n\n\"Disease insinuates a medical problem that will have an apparent sign or symptom,\" she said. \"Most people infected with common STDs are symptomless, or display mild symptoms, so the sexually transmitted virus or bacteria could be more appropriately described as an infection.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 10 percent of men and five to 30 percent of women with chlamydia show symptoms. Some estimates suggest that more than 90 percent of those with genital herpes will never be diagnosed; the red, painful sores associated with the condition can actually be mistaken for simple pimples or ingrown hairs. Gonorrhea is most common among women ages 15 to 24, and can be spread while symptomless. And if you do have symptoms, they might be mild, like vaginal discharge or burning during urination.\n\nThe invisible nature of most infections is why you need to get tested. Of course, if you or a partner notices sores, changes in urination, pain in the genitals or other abnormal symptoms, visit your doctor. But getting an STI test regardless of symptoms is also highly recommended, said Dr. Christine Greves, a board-certified ob/gyn and women's health expert at Orlando Health in Florida.\n\n\"The only way to prevent an STI is to abstain,\" she said. \"There are ways of lowering risk using different barriers, but I recommend getting regularly tested to all my female patients and their partners.\"\n\nYour doctor can advise you on the best course of action if you have an STI. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. Antivirals can shorten or decrease outbreaks of herpes, and nitroimidazoles can be prescribed to reduce your risk of transmission and shorten symptoms of trichomoniasis.\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself during oral sex\n\nFirst and foremost, get tested and get treatment before engaging in sex of any kind \u2015 including oral sex. If you notice an abnormal lesion on your partner's genitals, don't engage in oral. \"The presence of active disease or sores on the genitals or mouth of either party will increase the risk of transmission,\" Berglund said. See your doctor, finish the entire course of treatment and listen to medical advice before you have sex.\n\nBarriers can also lower your risk of contracting or passing an STI. \"Condoms and dental dams, which are thin sheets of latex, can be used during oral sex,\" Rodgers said. A dental dam is applied over the vaginal opening; in a pinch, a condom can be fashioned into a dental dam and you can also use water-based lube for more sensation.\n\nThere are also other ways you can physically connect with your partner that are risk-free or lower risk. Other sexual activities that lower the possibility of spreading an STI are kissing, fondling, masturbation or mutual masturbation, Rodgers said.\n\n\"Realistically, there is no such thing as 100 percent safe sex, but rather safer sex with regular STI testing and the use of precautionary measures,\" Rodgers said. \"The more knowledge a person has, the better.\"\n\nDon't skip steps when it comes to your health, sexual or otherwise. Get educated, get tested and then get it on."

He paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool \u201cto bring the world closer together,\u201d but in many ways, it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people. Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Zuckerberg declared: \u201cWe do not allow hate groups on Facebook, overall.\u201d As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform. Zuckerberg\u2019s claim hit a nerve for me as well. Two months ago, a private Facebook group devoted to alt-right Trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me. When alerted to the situation, Facebook\u2019s response was, essentially, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\n\nFacebook/Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash The cover photo for the closed Facebook group \"Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.\"\n\nOn Feb. 13, I awoke to find a stream of friend requests on Facebook and a startling message from a man I did not know: \u201cThere is some random weirdo posting pictures of you.\u201d He sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private Facebook group \u201cEmperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash,\u201d which had more than 72,000 members at the time.

There was a problem processing your signup; please try again later Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nInstagram CLOSE There I was: standing on the beach in Oahu, wearing shorts, a bikini top and a cardigan. I loved that photo \u2015 it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years. I posted it on Facebook last April. I was stunned as I stared at it almost a year later, along with my full name, literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read: \u201cThis is going to be a hard one guys. Huffington Post reporter, smash or pass?\u201d\n\nFacebook A cropped copy of my photo posted in \"Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.\"\n\nImmediately, I requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators: \u201cWhere do you fall on the cuck spectrum?\u201d and \u201cAre you a normie?\u201d I turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible, so I could email them to the appropriate representatives at Facebook. As is common in the publishing industry, HuffPost and Facebook work closely on products, partnerships and other shared objectives. \u201cIt is a lot of comments,\u201d he warned. \u201cNone of them are nice.\u201d\n\nFacebook Screenshots of comments left on the \"smash or pass\" photo, including \"smash with a bat for being a cunt.\"\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are. Or to see them casually suggest they\u2019d like to \u201csmash,\u201d \u201cpump\u201d and \u201cskullfuck\u201d you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title. Dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to Facebook. Several hours later, Facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that \u201cdoesn\u2019t follow our Community Standards.\u201d It added: \u201cWe removed that specific content \u2026 instead of the entire group.\u201d But subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there. A staff manager at HuffPost also contacted Facebook directly to request that the post be taken down as quickly as possible. His message contained the screenshots of comments and stressed the matter\u2019s urgency. Two days later, a representative followed up and asked him for the link to the post with the photo, which was inaccessible to anyone who did not belong to the private group (and which I had failed to obtain from the growing swarm of \u201ctrolls\u201d in my inbox). The Facebook representative said that without the link, not much could be done. So the harassment continued, and it worsened.\n\nFacebook \"Shoot some conservative values all over her tits,\" one commenter wrote.\n\nAs my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests (now 890 and counting), one of my colleagues wrote a public Facebook post asking others to report the group, hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed. Soon enough, the trolls found her profile, too. \u201cWe\u2019ll just post your pic and do a smash or pass,\u201d one man wrote on her status below two other nasty comments. Another appeared in her inbox: \u201cSMASH.\u201d It was clear that she was also being targeted in \u201cEmperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.\u201d She deactivated her account. My photo remained posted in the group for at least six days \u2015 long enough for it to garner even more attention and be shared to at least three other pages. So after nearly a week of apparent inaction from Facebook, I got in touch with one of the group\u2019s administrators, who can review reports about members\u2019 posts, remove content and revoke membership as they please. He told me that the picture might have \u201cflown under the radar.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d he said, after assuring me he had taken the photo down. \u201cBlame Facebook for their stupid reporting system.\u201d When I asked him to let me join the group, so I could see for myself that it was gone, he refused.\n\nFacebook \"Only if she gets deported over the wall, or dropped off at a refugee camp immediately afterwards,\" someone wrote.\n\nWith a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe, Facebook\u2019s role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated. It has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its Community Standards (including posts containing nudity, hate speech and violent or graphic content). These users may have their content removed or their accounts disabled, or may even be reported to law enforcement. Moderating hate speech is an issue \u201cthat we struggle with continuously,\u201d Zuckerberg said last week. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of content flowing through the systems and a lot of reports, and, unfortunately, we don\u2019t always get these things right when people report it to us.\u201d He vowed that Facebook would have \u201cmore than 20,000 people working on security and content review across the company\u201d by the end of the year, acknowledging that \u201cno amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.\u201d But instead of advocating for more moderators, pundits have long been calling for greater transparency surrounding the organization\u2019s internal content review standards to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability \u2015 a plea many say has fallen on deaf ears.\n\nFacebook \"Smash with a ballgag so she doesn't speak.\"\n\nA Guardian investigation into leaked documents from Facebook, including private guidelines for content moderation, revealed last year that phrases like \u201cTo snap a bitch\u2019s neck, make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat\u201d are allowed, while others like \u201cSomeone shoot Trump\u201d are not. The report noted that moderators often have \u201cjust 10 seconds\u201d to make a decision when evaluating material. It also said many have concerns about \u201cthe inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies,\u201d especially those regarding sexual content. Experts have cautioned that inadequate moderation practices can have serious consequences, such as fostering a culture of online impunity \u2015 leading sites like Facebook to become breeding grounds and safe havens for harassment. Whereas trolls used to work under the cover of relative anonymity on sites like 4chan and Reddit, many of the Facebook users who commented on my photo and sent me grotesque messages, astonishingly, felt comfortable enough to do so using their real profiles \u2015 with their real names, photos, locations and even places of employment listed.\n\nFacebook \"Smash so hard she goes conservative.\""

			"text": "Manisha Koirala, one of the most successful actors who reigned during the 90s, is enjoying her second innings in the Hindi film industry. From indie movies to a Netflix anthology, to a much-awaited biopic on Sanjay Dutt where she plays Nargis, 48-year-old Koirala says she's looking for meaningful work and filmmakers are reaching out.\n\nIn the notoriously ageist world of Bollywood, where it is a rarity for an actress to find work in her late 40s, Koirala is glad she's defying the archaic norms and is getting to make daring choices.\n\nKoirala, during a conversation at a club in Mumbai's Juhu, said that her battle with cancer, a few career mistakes and a divorce have enabled her to carve a life where her choices aren't driven by fear, but by a hunger to seek out empowering characters that have depth and that break the clutter.\n\nKoirala spoke candidly about getting the chance to do films as diverse as 1942: A Love Story, Khaamoshi, and Bombay, how she fought predatory behavior in the 90s, and her strategy for the next phase of her career.\n\nHere are excerpts from the interview, lightly edited for clarity.\n\nFrom the early 90s to a Netflix film (Lust Stories), it's been quite a journey for you. How different are your choices now compared to the ones you were making in the past?\n\nToday, I can't sign up for any random movie. In the 90s, I worked with some of the biggest directors of the time, but I was also part of some really embarrassing films (laughs). There were various reasons to do those films. But today, I can't do that. I have to make smart choices because every choice is important. I've to be very, very selective about the work I choose.\n\nAt the same time, I'm at a stage in life where I can't over-exert myself. I don't want to be a busy star. I am done being busy-busy-busy, juggling three shifts in a day. I want time by myself and play characters that broaden my idea of acting as a vocation. I can't get into the rut. I want to live. I want to wake up and smell a rose. Breathe deeply. Go for a swim. Read a book. Have a sound sleep. That's my plan.\n\nBombay, Dil Se, 1942: A Love Story, Khaamoshi -- these are perhaps some of the best films of the 90s and you were exceptional in all of them. When you evaluate scripts now, do you feel the burden of expectations because the audience holds you up to a certain standard?\n\nI do, absolutely. I am a hungry artist. I crave the satisfaction that an actor gets after doing 10 wrong takes and getting the 11th right. That feeling of cracking a scene is something else. Yes, there are expectations but I am going about it by looking for characters I haven't played before, like Reena from Lust Stories.\n\nIt was my favorite of the lot. What I liked about it was how the woman, instead of being tossed around between her husband and lover, takes ownership of the situation and turns the tables against them. There was an emotional nakedness in your performance and while the morality of the situation is debatable, the fact remained that your character had complete agency.\n\nI loved how Dibakar (Banerjee) went about it. We didn't have a bound script so we were organically moving along. We were talking about how a woman would respond if she was thrown in such a situation. And yes, the infidelity part is debatable, but I felt that her character is more honest and bolder than both the men. That appeals to me. Her, going through the confusion is a great story arc. For a moment, she wants to be with the lover, and then she realises he's not fully into it. So she withdraws. She's constantly wavering and second-guessing and as a story, I was sold on how uniquely authentic it was.\n\nWe, as an industry, are still coy about exploring women's sexuality on-screen. Lust Stories did that but ultimately it's a film on Netflix, a premium platform that is accessible to a very specific high-end audience.\n\nOur films are designed and written to appeal to the male gaze. Slowly, that idea is shifting world over. How women see love and life make for great stories and only now are they being told. Even then, I feel, our stories shouldn't just be restricted to the sexuality. Just because it's about women it doesn't have to be sexual. The gaze should be female. Which is my problem with today's trend. A woman-centric story doesn't always have to be about sex. If you make it about sex you are again, effectively, appealing to men.\n\nHindustan Times via Getty Images\n\nDear Maya, Lust Stories, now Sanju -- it's commendable that we've finally reached a stage where the shelf life of women isn't restrictive, although we still have a long way to go. However, I do feel that while the Khans, who started out with you, continue to romance women half their age, the roles you are being offered, in two cases at least, were that of mothers. Is there an inherent sexism there that we need to question?\n\nOh absolutely. And I do hope that it eventually changes. See, all of us here want to extend our career span. There are healthier ways of doing it and then there are other ways. I don't judge others but I choose the healthy route. I want to look my age on-screen. I want to choose roles that reflect the time that I am in. Aging is the most natural process and to try and defy it for commercial reasons is something I don't approve of. I am not the kind who'll do plastic surgery to look young. I don't think I will be comfortable playing a college-going girl now.\n\nRight... I was just making a broader point about how the men get offered a variety of roles versus the lack of options for a woman in her late-40s.\n\nI hear you. Just the other day, I was telling a friend that cinema is about stories. So why do we restrict storytelling only till the youth? Why choose that timespan? I hope that more and more 40+ women get a broad spectrum of roles to choose from and that'll happen once we've more women in the industry. Life doesn't end with youth. It goes on till it wants to. My battle with cancer has fundamentally changed me as a person and I am glad to have a new perspective on my life and career. In a way, I am glad that work is still trickling my way but I am hungry for roles that are meaningful and empowering.\n\nWhat do you miss about the 90s? While there were some great films, it was like a pubescent time for Bollywood. Awkward, loud, melodramatic. How do you compare the two eras?\n\nOh, I've done enough melodrama and I hope people have forgotten those movies. I certainly haven't. I am not going to remind you. We did some terrible stuff. The other day, Danny (Denzongpa) was saying how the films of today are so vastly different than what we did. The 80s were terrible and the melodrama continued in the 90s. He said, \"We did such horrible films. We should be glad the audience still made us stars and gave us a career.\" I laughed and laughed.\n\nThat line is so true! Because of the exposure to world cinema, the audience today is much more receptive to the subtleties on screen. There are all sorts of stories and we should just be glad the 90s are behind us although I am happy that people remember only my good work!\n\nWhile it is generally a better time for cinema now, it's also a time when women are coming forward to talk about years of exploitative behavior. The 90s, as we all know, were a very problematic time, not that now is a lot better. Do you recall any instances of predatory or abusive behavior?\n\nI always fought back. I have always been the kind who wouldn't take any and I fought back. So i think people were a little, I don't know, scared of me. Maybe scared is not the right word. Because I was bold and a bit moohphat (loud mouth). And people knew they couldn't get away by saying nonsense to me. From Day 1, I made sure about that. But that is not to say that I didn't face any bad behavior.\n\nThere were a few. Being a woman, you face harassment anywhere in the world. Earlier today, two men were staring at me while I was swimming. They didn't bother till I had my trainer around. The minute he left, they started saying things like, \"oh she used to be a heroine. Look at her now. She's gone fat and old.\" I just shut my eyes and thought of what to do. Eventually, I complained. So as women, you need to fight battles everyday. It's really up to how we respond and we need to be intelligent about it.\n\nIn this industry, it's always up to women on how they respond, because that stuff is bound to be.\n\nWhat I feel is that women shouldn't have to go through it to have a career.\n\nAbsolutely. Now there's more awareness. With women coming forward, with journalists writing about it, women are much more confident now. There's also a fear in men that she'll go to the cops. It's great. But, what I fear is that this movement shouldn't turn turtle. Women shouldn't utilise or exploit the situation. One has to be balanced. If you are focused and hardworking, nothing can take away from your success. There are no easy routes.\n\nYou had a fallout with Subhash Ghai after your debut film Saudagar. You didn't work with him again. What was that about?\n\nBasically, there was a public fallout that had happened. We were at the music launch of the film and I didn't want to speak to certain media and Subhasji wanted me to speak to them. I was actually trying to avoid them as they'd written something nasty. He made a comment and (pauses) then Mom and I said what we had to say and left. That became big news. We've patched up. Years have gone by. He's given me a break. I am grateful for that.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

			"text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Briefing reporters on the results of President Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential medical evaluation, White House doctor Ronny Jackson on Tuesday emphasized the president\u2019s \u201cexcellent\u201d health and dismissed the question on many people\u2019s minds since the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s bombshell book: Is the president mentally up to his job?\n\nAs HuffPost\u2019s S.V. Date notes, \u201cWolff\u2019s book, Fire and Fury, portrays a delusional, ignorant and impulsive chief executive who may also be suffering from a loss of his cognitive skills \u2015 a description that has brought into public discourse what had previously been off-limits.\u201d\n\nSome hoped Trump\u2019s Friday\u2019s medical evaluation would include a cognitive or psychiatric assessment of the 71-year-old president. The government recommends Medicare recipients over age 65 undergo a cognitive assessment as part of their annual physicals.\n\nJackson stressed that Trump\u2019s examination at Walter Reed Military Medical Center contained a cognitive assessment that the president passed with flying colors.\n\nHe made sure to point out that the president passed a \u201clonger, more difficult\u201d version, and that administering it was \u201cnot driven by clinical concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that he has any cognitive issues,\u201d Jackson said, adding that Trump \u201cis very articulate when he speaks to me.\u201d\n\nLater, he added that it was \u201cimpressive\u201d that Trump \u201chas a lot of energy and a lot of stamina,\u201d and is \u201cvery sharp.\u201d\n\nAs far as Trump\u2019s basic health statistics, he is 75 inches tall, weighs 239 pounds, has 20/30 vision, and had \u201cnormal\u201d results for his motor and cognitive functions, as well as \u201cabove average exercise capacity based on age and sex,\u201d according to Jackson.\n\n\u201cIn summary, the president\u2019s overall health is excellent,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAll data indicates the president is healthy and will remain so for the duration of his presidency.\u201d\n\nJackson said he suggested Trump should try to lose between 10 to 15 pounds over the next year, and recommended a healthier diet and \u201ca dedicated, defined exercise program.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThe results are in line with what Trump disclosed during his campaign, in notes from both his personal doctor and, for some reason, Dr. Oz. His personal physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein \u2015 who once famously made the dubious claim that Trump would become \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\u201d \u2015 reported in 2016 that Trump was 6-foot-3 and 236 pounds, took a statin to lower his cholesterol, and had no history of cancer or other major medical problems.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s erratic behavior as president, and his age, leave many Americans wondering if he might be suffering from some sort of cognitive decline. Yale University psychiatry professor Bandy Lee, who has not personally evaluated Trump, told HuffPost that \u201cwe\u2019re seeing signs of impairment in the sitting president ... [and] it\u2019s been markedly getting worse.\u201d\n\nTrump last week fueled talk about his mental fitness, vehemently denying he has mental health issues and calling himself \u201ca very stable genius.\u201d"

It's not like you don't know where they went and you're hoping one day they'll pop up between the couch cushions.\n\nThe fact is, people die, and sometimes, dying can take a long time. It's heart-breaking, it's hard, and -- sometimes -- it's grossly unfair.\n\nI can only speak from my own experiences here, but my Dad dying from cancer was akin to someone dying from a thousand paper cuts. It happened bit by bit, over years and years.\n\nFirst came the diagnosis -- upsetting, of course -- but prostate cancer was a \"good\" cancer, so thank God for that. Then came the news it wasn't the normal kind of prostate cancer, so things would be more difficult. Then came the treatments, unrelenting in their aggression, and then came the news it wasn't going away. It was terminal -- but we still had three to five years.\n\nBut that turned out not to be the case either, and so it goes.\n\nAs I said, it's really, really shitty. And to be honest, no one really gets it unless they've been through it themselves, which is where my old flatmate Beth comes in. Having lost her mum to cancer, Beth knew exactly what I was going through, and had a list of advice to boot. Not necessarily for me, but for everyone else.\n\nBecause here's the thing: when someone you love is dying, even if you don't want to talk about it, you have to. People will straight up ask. Questions like, \"how is your Dad these days?\" will fly thick and fast and it will your job to inform them that, no, chemo is no longer an option, or to reassure them with, yes, he sure is hanging in there.\n\nOf course, people only want to help. They care. They don't know it's the seventh time you've had that conversation that day. And it's nice to be asked. You don't want not to be asked, as though it's taboo or he's dead already. See how muddy the waters are already?\n\nDealing with this situation can be awkward, and difficult, and, to be frank, sometimes people can really screw it up. So here are some tips, courtesy of Beth and me, about what to do if you have a friend whose loved one is dying.\n\nQuit it with the sad eyes\n\nWant to know what sad eyes are? They look like this.\n\nSeriously, stop it. Wipe those big, trembling sympathy balls off your face right now. No one wants to see them.\n\nIt's one thing to actually be sympathetic and concerned, it's another to try and force those feelings to beam out of your face. If you want to ask after someone, ask them in your normal voice, with your normal face, and be prepared for whatever the answer might be.\n\nAsk, but don't probe\n\nYour friend will let you know when and if they feel like getting into the nitty gritty details, so follow their lead. By all means, ask them about the situation when you see them -- they'll be expecting it, anyway -- but if you're getting the signal they don't want to talk about it, then they don't want to talk about it.\n\nTrust me, if you're a close friend, the time will come when they will unload. If you're not a close friend, you'll get what they want to tell you, and that's it.\n\nAvoid clich\u00e9s\n\n\"He'll pull through.\" \"He's a fighter.\" \"If anyone can beat it, it's him.\"\n\nThough meaning well, these expressions are actually just annoying, particularly if it's a terminal disease.\n\nInstead, why not try \"So what does that mean?\" or even a simple \"I'm so sorry. It sounds really rough. Is there anything I can do?\"\n\nIt's okay to cry, but it's not about you\n\nWhen I told my best friend that Dad had a matter of months to live, she burst into tears. She then spent the next 10 minutes apologising for crying, because she should be comforting me and not the other way around.\n\nIt is okay to cry. My best friend loved my Dad. Of course she was upset. Her crying just showed me how much she cared.\n\nHowever, in a different situation, I bumped into an old school friend, someone who I'm no longer really in touch with, who positively wailed at the news. She rattled off every single thing she could think about Dad and how tragic it was and oh god WHYY while everyone in the chemist turned and stared.\n\nThat was weird. Try not to do that.\n\nHerbal remedies are not a cure\n\nI think the last time I truly saw red was when someone I barely knew suggested cancer was totally curable if you just did a bit of research online, and that my Dad should try a coffee enema. Gee, if only he had bothered to Google.\n\nTrust me -- no one wants to hear about how some chick in Byron cured cancer by thinking only good thoughts. If that stuff worked, no one in their right mind would line up for the invasive treatments currently available. Do you really think anyone does chemo for funsies?\n\nFinally, if the worst happens...\n\nIf the person in question passes away, here are some things you should do.\n\nGo to the funeral. If appropriate, offer to help at the wake. Be available if your friend needs you, even if that means just getting really drunk with them and having a good cry. Send flowers IN A VASE. This is very important. Your friend will be most likely inundated with flower deliveries, and it's unlikely they will own enough vases to deal with them all. Be patient. Even though everyone has known this was coming for some time, it's still a shock when it eventually happens, and they'll be needing your support for some time to come.\n\nI think at the end of the day, the most important thing is to still be yourself and to remain true to the relationship you have. Your friend doesn't want a censored, watered-down, super sympathetic version of you. They just want you. And they probably want you to say something like: \"Well this is really shit. Can I get you a giant glass of wine?\""

But it's hard to ignore the many ways in which the event is, and always has been, incredibly gendered.\n\nWhile many are criticizing the sexual harassment and sexism pervasive at this year's World Cup, sexism in the world of sports (or anywhere) is nothing new at all. But seeing how the World Cup is currently in its throes, there's no time like the present to take a look at some of the many shocking ways in which this year's mega-event has truly crossed the line, including for sports journalists that are women.\n\nJulia Guimar\u00e3\n\nOn Sunday, Julia Guimar\u00e3es, a sports reporter for Brazil's TV Globo and sportv, had to scold a man who tried to kiss her during a live report in front of a stadium in Yekaterinburg before the Senegal-Japan match. She successfully ducked the idiot and proceeded to tell him off as her mic was cut. \"Don't do this,\" she said. \"I don't allow you to do this, never, OK? This is not polite. This is not right. Never do this. Never do this to a woman, OK? Respect.\"\n\nGreat response from Brazilian TV journalist Julia Guimaraes of Sportv to unacceptable behaviour. Not easy to show such restraint in the face of harassment. pic.twitter.com/eFVZz6gdMA \u2014 Colin Millar (@Millar_Colin) June 24, 2018\n\nGuimar\u00e3es later tweeted that it's \"hard to find words,\" and that similar incidents had also happened to her twice already in Russia, one of these at the Egypt-Uruguay game. \"It's awful. I feel helpless, vulnerable. This time I gave an answer, but it's sad, people do not understand. I wanted to understand why you think you have a right to do that,\" she said, according to a translation.\n\nJulieth Gonzalez Theran\n\nBerlin-based Colombian journalist Julieth Gonzalez Theran was groped and kissed during a live-air broadcast at the World Cup. It happened fast. As she was giving a live report from Moscow, a man appeared out of nowhere, grabbed her breast and kissed her on the cheek. She continued with her report, fully ignoring the guy, but later expressed her outrage on Instagram.\n\nClaudia Neumann\n\nClaudia Neumann is the first woman ever to narrate a men's World Cup game for German public broadcaster ZDF. Sadly, and unsurprisingly, Neumann has experienced a barrage of hatefully sexist online abuse and criticism from male fans.\n\nAt the start of this year's World Cup, she responded to the internet hate calmly. \"No, I do not care about it,\" she said, adding that the internet hate represents only a \"minority that receives a lot of attention.\"\n\nBurger King's \"controversial\" World Cup ad campaign\n\nYo, check out this: Burger King Russia's ad was honestly and truly offering money and free burgers to Russian women impregnated by Russian World Cup players. Unsurprisingly, it was removed after people, you know, reacted.\n\n\"Each will receive 3 million rubles [$47,000 USD],\" said the ad, \"and a lifelong supply of Whoppers. For these girls, it will be possible to get the best football genes and will lay down the success of the Russian national team on several generations ahead.\"\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether or not this next-level vile ad was a response to comments made by Russian politician Tamara Pletnyova, who urged Russian women not to have sex with foreign World Cup visitors, I'm calling multiple isms on this one either way. Burger King has since issued an apology, but, um, where to even start?\n\nGetty Images joins the party too, because why not\n\nIf I haven't sufficiently rained on your World Cup parade just yet, Getty Images posted a gallery of photographs titled \"World Cup 2018: The Sexiest Fans,\" comprised entirely of shots of (conventionally) attractive (and in most cases, scantily clad) women. They, of course, came under the gun after that for not feeding their straight women (or gay/bi men) viewers any eye candy whatsoever, and seemingly mocking the concept of women enjoying sports. Getty has since removed the gallery and issued a brief apology.\n\nBrazilian UN Women issues a statement\n\nThe many misogynist incidents at this year's World Cup are just the latest evidence that rape culture is thriving around the world, and knows no cultural bounds.\n\nDylan Martinez / Reuters A fan reacts after the match between Brazil and Mexico on July 2, 2018.\n\nIn addition to these incidents, a bombardment of Twitter posts showcasing sexist and harassing behaviours by Brazilian soccer fans in Russia actually prompted the Brazilian office of UN Women to issue a statement, decrying the \"deliberate intention of some Brazilian fans to sexually harass women during the World Cup.\"\n\nFor me, one silver-lined takeaway in all of this is social media. In many cases it has been a real outlet for targeted women reporters, and a powerful tool for rallying support and rightful indignation, as well as spreading awareness. Because what more can we really do than spread the good word and fight misogynist bullshit wherever and whenever possible?\n\nNSFW: This article was originally published on Bellesa.co\n\nHave you been affected personally by this or another issue?

Over 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy in recent years, bringing the issue of immigration to the forefront and contributing to the rise of far-right leaders such as Lega\u2019s Matteo Salvini.\n\nItaly has been in a period of political gridlock since its election in March left no clear winner. But in recent weeks the eurosceptic Five Star and Lega parties have moved closer to agreeing on a governing coalition, a deal that would give Italy one of the most populist governments in all of Europe.\n\nAn earlier draft of the contract between the two parties, published by HuffPost Italia this week, caused widespread concern in Europe. The document showed that the parties wanted to take a combative stance toward the EU, and even stated that they would look to find ways that the country could potentially opt-out of the eurozone.\n\nThe Milan stock market fell after the news and investors dropped Italian assets amid fears of political and economic instability.\n\nThe latest document waters down many of the more extreme policies, however, including mention of asking the European Central Bank to cancel nearly $300 billion in debt and talk of leaving the euro currency.\n\nEven with a more moderate attitude toward the EU, the parties are expected to attempt radical domestic changes after promising to eliminate pension cuts and boost the welfare state. Economists worry that such goals are unrealistic given that Italy is deeply in debt \u2015 making up 132 percent of its GDP.\n\nFive Star and Lega are expected to announce a finalized deal in the coming days, ending months of negotiations and ushering in an uncertain new era for Italy."

But this mineral is actually vital for many processes in the body.\n\nThankfully, we can obtain magnesium through our diets, specifically by eating loads of plant foods -- including dark chocolate.\n\nWhy do I need magnesium?\n\n\"Magnesium is a mineral that our bodies rely on to feel fit, healthy and full of vitality,\" nutritionist Fiona Tuck told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"This mineral is an important one, being that it is a co-factor for hundreds of enzyme reactions within the body. These enzymes are vital for a variety of important processes such as the conversion of energy from carbohydrates, fats and protein, not to mention healthy DNA synthesis, blood sugar balance, bone health and a calm nervous system.\"\n\nGetty\n\nMagnesium is also required for \"formation of bones, muscle contractions and blood pressure regulation\", accredited practising dietitian Alexandra Parker explained.\n\n\"Magnesium is also thought to play a role in sleep by improving our sleep quality. On average, men require around 400mg of magnesium per day and women need around 300mg per day.\"\n\nWhat happens when I'm magnesium deficient?\n\nAccording to accredited practising dietitian Anna Debenham, magnesium deficiency is not overly common in otherwise healthy people.\n\n\"In the short-term, low intakes of magnesium won't actually result in any noticeable symptoms as our kidneys conserve magnesium when intakes are low,\" Debenham told HuffPost Australia. \"However, low intakes over extended periods can lead you to become deficient.\"\n\nWhen this occurs, we can experience an array of negative symptoms, mostly to do with energy levels.\n\n\"Magnesium is involved in helping to regulate calcium, vitamin D, blood sugar and hormonal balance, so there is little surprise to learn that low magnesium levels can lead to chronic fatigue-type symptoms, low mood, anxiety, eye tics, insomnia, high blood pressure, muscle cramps (which can be due to low calcium too) and a poor tolerance to dealing with stress,\" Tuck said.\n\nSymptoms of magnesium deficiency include: Loss of appetite\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nFatigue\n\nWeakness\n\nAbnormal heart rhythms\n\nNumbness or tingling\n\nMuscle contractions and cramps\n\n\"When our magnesium levels are low, we can start craving stimulants such as coffee to boost our energy, or chocolate which is a natural source of magnesium (but not the sickly sweet milk chocolate commonly found in the confectionery aisle).\"\n\nWhich foods contain magnesium?\n\n\"Magnesium is found in a variety of foods, but the best sources tend to be green leafy vegetables, raw cacao, nuts and seeds,\" Tuck said.\n\n\"Include magnesium-rich foods at every meal to help boost magnesium. Aim to include at least two servings of vegetables with every meal and a couple of pieces of fruit daily. Reduce sugar, alcohol and processed foods to help up your magnesium intake.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Another reason to eat (and drink) your greens.\n\nFoods which contain magnesium:\n\nGreen leafy vegetables (e.g. spinach and kale)\n\nFruit (figs, avocado, banana and raspberries)\n\nNuts and seeds\n\nLegumes (black beans, chickpeas and kidney beans)\n\nVegetables (peas, broccoli, cabbage, green beans, artichokes, asparagus, brussels sprouts)\n\nSeafood (salmon, mackerel, tuna)\n\nWhole grains (brown rice and oats)\n\nRaw cacao\n\nDark Chocolate\n\nTofu\n\nBaked beans\n\nChlorella powder\n\nHow can I test if I'm magnesium deficient?\n\nWhile you can get magnesium levels tested via a blood test, this isn't always a reliable method.\n\n\"If your doctor suspects that your magnesium level is too low, they may order a serum magnesium test. However, this has not been properly validated as a reliable indicator of body magnesium status,\" Parker explained. \"Assessing magnesium status is difficult because most magnesium is inside cells or in bones.\"\n\nIn any case, if you are in doubt over your magnesium levels, see a qualified healthcare practitioner who can look at possible signs and symptoms of magnesium deficiency and trigger factors, such as high stress levels or a diet low in magnesium.\n\n\"Combined with pathology tests, this can give a better overall picture of whether you need more magnesium,\" Tuck said.\n\ngpointstudio via Getty Images People who have gastrointestinal diseases, type 2 diabetes, alcohol dependence and older adults have a higher risk of magnesium deficiency.\n\nShould I take magnesium supplements?\n\nAs with most supplements, it's best to obtain important vitamins and minerals through your diet.\n\n\"If you want to maximise your health, you can't go past a balanced diet. Loading up on plenty of plant foods is the simplest way to get magnesium into your diet,\" Debenham said.\n\n\"You can, however, increase your magnesium intake by taking supplements, and this may be beneficial for some people. It is best to talk with your doctor or dietitian about magnesium supplementing, as excessive supplementation can lead to diarrhoea and stomach upsets.\"\n\nMagnesium supplements can also be poorly absorbed and thus work better for some people than others, Tuck explained.\n\n\"Those with poor gut function or malabsorption issues may be better to start with a topical magnesium spray. This is absorbed transdermally through the skin and can be used daily,\" Tuck said.\n\n\"For those people in need of a higher intake of magnesium, they may do better with a magnesium powder supplement and drink it in liquid form.\"\n\nClick below to subscribe to the Refresh podcast by HuffPost Australia on iTunes.\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST AUSTRALIA"

We got the TV-obsessed Richa Chadha to cut through the clutter and tell us what shows she's binging on online.\n\nStream on...\n\n1. Queer Eye (Netflix)\n\nNetflix\n\nI am currently hooked to Queer Eye. It's a very cool show that manages to bridge gaps and shun prejudices in people's minds and hearts by using something as simple as a makeover. I love that one of the hosts mentioned that he wants to reach out to Republicans in America with the show.\n\n2. Fauda (Netflix)\n\nNetflix\n\nFauda is a brilliant show. It's an out-and-out thriller and a very addictive one at that. I love watching content from other countries (Fauda is an Israeli show) as it opens up your eyes to different cultures and dynamics.\n\n3. Mindhunter, Evil Genius, and Wild Wild Country (Netflix) Netflix\n\nMini-series as an idea can be very exciting and these three titles aren't just engaging but also very informative and thought-provoking. They also make it to my list because they are very high on binge value. If you haven't gotten on to them yet, you've three great mini-series ahead of you.\n\n4. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix) Netflix\n\nI am a fan of Tina Fey and she is a producer on the show, which features Ellie Kemper in the lead role. It is a very cute and a funny show, in a typical New York comedy sense of the term. After working on a difficult film, this is the kind of comfort TV that I love coming back home to. Highly recommended.\n\n5. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime Video) Amazon Prime Video\n\nI quite like this show on Amazon Prime called The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. It deals with being a woman in a man's world at a time when feminism wasn't as widely understood or accepted as it is now. It's quite funny and has some great performances.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

She was found by her housekeeper at her Manhattan home, where she left a note, several outlets reported.\n\nSpade, born Katherine Noel Brosnahan, was best known for her namesake brand of high-end modern handbags that grew to incorporate other womenswear.

			"text": "For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America\u2019s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley\u2019s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form \u201cgiving circles\u201d to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like \u201chacker philanthropy\u201d and \u201ceffective altruism.\u201d These guys\u2014they are mostly guys\u2014believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by \"breaking shit.\" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world\u2019s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.\n\nGive Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today\u2019s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is \"a 1,000-pound gorilla.\" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, \"flip a whole city.\" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers\u2019 union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change \u201cis that it doesn\u2019t scale like a social network.\u201d I\u2019ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Seduced By Technology\n\nSince December I've been studying Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he\u2019s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about \"connecting people\" and \"building strong communities.\" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. \"We must build technology to make change,\" he wrote last fall. \"Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation.\" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it\u2014the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are \u201cThe Green Revolution.\u201d In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops\u2014varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.\n\nBefore and After the Green Revolution Per-capita income in Southeast Asia: $351 $1,027 Cereal production in Southeast Asia: 33.8M metric tons 73.6M metric tons +193 +118 1970 Go to 1970 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| 1995 Go to 1995\n\nIt's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to \"leapfrog\" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it\u2019s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of \"new crops, big changes.\" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. \"Technology,\" Toyama says, \"is the easiest part of any solution.\" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths\u2014seat belts, motorcycle helmets\u2014is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the \u201980s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. \"Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,\" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. \"Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer.\" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean \"leapfrogging\" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians\u2014and from Zuckerberg himself. \"A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,\" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. \"Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock.\" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. \"Even when you have the information,\" Toyama says, \"you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it.\" Also, when \u201cleapfrogging\u201d happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn\u2019t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn\u2019t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.\n\n$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money\n\nIn 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"meningitis belt.\" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. \"If you want to do something major,\" LaForce says, \"you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back.\" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to be specialists,\u201d says Gordon Perkin, the foundation\u2019s first director of global health. \u201cWe just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.\u201d This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It\u2019s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. \u201cAll the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,\u201d a former Rockefeller employee told me. \u201cTo make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.\u201d (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it \u201chas developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.\u201d)\n\nWon't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away\n\nThe Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same \"expert-itis,\" as a former grantee calls it. \"They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing.\" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. \"Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,\" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: \u201cWhile each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible.\") It\u2019s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. \"Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it\u2019s there,\" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. \"Move fast and break things\" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it\u2019s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and \"break things,\" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable\u2014and overlapping\u2014organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates\u2019 early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\u2014a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues \"vaccine bonds\" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests\u2014something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work\u2014then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, \u201cDon\u2019t expect to be the only solution out there.\u201d\n\nCapitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life\u2019s Problems\n\nWhat Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs\u2014transform, reimagine, revolutionize\u2014the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? \"This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,\" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He\u2019s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg\u2019s most recent donations wasn\u2019t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge\u2019s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students\u2014and teachers\u2014are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent\n\nIt's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.\n\nThe primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it\u2019s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She\u2019s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a \u201cmodel,\u201d one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as \u201ca scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.\u201d But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be \u201csustainable,\u201d microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico\u2019s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos\u2019 customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle\u2014informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity\u2014from which it was designed to free them.\n\nHow Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we\u2019ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he\u2019s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he\u2019s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.\n\nIt's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies\u2014they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.\n\nGo Beyond Giving Directly\n\nIn 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need\u2014bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats\u2014what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them\u2014but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly\u2019s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out \"conditional\" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into \"social safety nets\"\u2014unemployment and pension benefits, basically\u2014in developing countries. \"Welfare\" sounds a lot less \u201cbreak shit\u201d than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one\u2014that\u2019s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious\u2014and largely unheralded\u2014project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can\u2019t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical\u2014a perfect project for Zuckerberg.\n\nOut of Reach and Out of Luck"

They have a lot of slang terms for money in the U.S. While the meaning behind some of these terms may seem obvious, it's less intuitive for others. \"Bucks\", which has become synonymous with \"dollars\" in modern vernacular, is one example of the latter. So why do we call dollars \"bucks\"? A widely held belief involves the use of the word \"buck\" to mean \"a male animal; especially, a male deer or antelope\". Back in the 18th century, European settlers and Native Americans often traded buckskins, or deerskins, as a form of currency. One of the earliest cited references to bucks as currency is a 1748 journal entry from Conrad Weiser, a Pennsylvania Dutch pioneer, interpreter and diplomat. In his journal, he described the rate for a cask of whiskey as \"5 Bucks\", reportedly in reference to deerskins. The journal also cited a man who was \"robbed of the value of 300 Bucks.\"\n\nOne deerskin wasn't necessarily the equivalent of one \"buck,\" as various factors could determine the value, like the size, quality, age of the deer and more. Official U.S. dollars weren't minted until several decades after Weiser's journal entries, but it appears buckskins and the word buck stuck around in the currency arena. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a usage of \"bucks\" to mean \"dollars\" from the Democratic State Journal in 1856: \"Bernard, assault and battery upon Wm. Croft, mulcted in the sum of twenty bucks.\" Evidence from the 19th century also suggests a buckskin was sometimes the equivalent of one dollar. Henry Howe's 1851 Historical Collections of Ohio states, \"A muskrat skin was equal to a quarter of a dollar; a raccoon skin, a third of a dollar; a doe skin, half a dollar, and a buck skin, 'the almighty dollar'.\" James Buchanan's Sketches of the History, Manners, and Customs of North American Indians from 1824 lists \"each buck-skin one dollar\". Although the deerskin origin story is a popular one, there are other theories beyond this folklore. One idea is that \"buck\" is just a shortened form of the word \"sawbuck,\" which is slang for a $10 bill. This is thought to be because one of the earliest $10 bills featured the Roman numeral X, which resembles a \"sawbuck\" \u2015 a frame for holding wood to be chopped and sawed.\n\nNational Numismatic Collection/National Museum of American History A $10 bill from the 1860s.\n\nAlthough \"sawbuck\" meant a $10 bill, the shortened \"buck\" generally referred to the U.S. paper currency introduced in the 1860s and later came to specify one dollar, according to Russell A Potter, a professor of English and media studies at Rhode Island College. In a discussion on historian Mary Miley Theobald's History Myths Debunked blog, Potter wrote, \"The derivation of buck (dollar) from the trade in deerskins is (in my view) unlikely, as the usage is quite scarce prior to the introduction of paper currency.\" The professor acknowledged that words can have multiple origins that developed during different times and places \u2015 but posited the sawbuck theory as a more plausible explanation, especially because \"buck\" didn't become nationally popular until the late 19th century. \"The 'sawbuck' theory has the advantage of a clearer line of plausible transmission, but even with that theory, there are relatively few examples until late in this same period (as a casual slang term, it likely had a long gestation in common parlance before it began to see the light of print),\" Potter explained. \"I would certainly say that the deerskin theory should not be presented as unquestionably true; offering it alongside the 'sawbuck'/$10 theory is probably about the best that can be done.\" Yet another theory relates the slang \"buck\" to the game of poker.\n\nUniversal History Archive via Getty Images 19th century image of men at the card table."

But that's not how the world works in 2015.\n\nThe Myth of the Ethical Shopper Michael Hobbes\n\nThere\u2019s this video that went viral earlier this year. On Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, a vending machine is selling plain white T-shirts for \u20ac2 each. Customers approach in ones and twos, insert coins, pick a size. Then, before the shirt comes out, a photo appears\u2014a black-and-white image of rows of sewing machines. \u201cMeet Manisha,\u201d the screen reads, dissolving to a close-up of a girl in a headscarf who looks about 16. She earns \u201cas little as 13 cents an hour each day for 16 hours.\u201d The Berliners put their hands over their mouths. \u201cDo you still want to buy this shirt?\u201d the display asks. The menu comes up again. This time, the options are \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cdonate.\u201d As the music swells, all the shoppers press \u201cdonate.\u201d For a generation now, buying better has been one of our most potent forms of protest. Who doesn\u2019t want to believe that he can rescue Manisha from misery simply by purchasing the right T-shirt? The same idea underpins hundreds of earnest NGO advocacy campaigns urging people to take action against the Swooshtika, Badidas, Killer Coke. It prompted a much-praised John Oliver expos\u00e9 in which he blasts H&M for selling \u201csuspiciously cheap\u201d clothes sourced in Bangladesh. The only trouble is, this narrative is bullshit. It all started in the mid-\u201990s, when anti-sweatshop mania burst into the mainstream of American culture. Naked people chanted outside the opening of an Old Navy, Jennifer Love Hewitt led an anti-sweatshop protest on \"Party of Five,\" Kathie Lee Gifford cried in front of Congress. Nearly every major apparel brand was, at one point or another, the target of a boycott campaign. Radiohead told its millions of fans to read No Logo, Naomi Klein\u2019s investigative polemic against multinational corporations. And for a while there, it worked. The major apparel companies adopted codes of conduct, first banning just the most egregious stuff\u2014workers under 16, forced overtime\u2014then expanding to health and safety, environmental protection and social investment. Since 1998, Nike has followed U.S. clean air standards in all of its factories worldwide, while Levi\u2019s gives financial literacy classes to some of its seamstresses. Every company from Hanes to Halliburton has a social responsibility report. An entire ecosystem of independent inspectors and corporate consultants has sprung up, applying auditing standards that are as pedantic and uncompromising as the NGOs advocating for them. But in the past 25 years, the apparel industry, the entire global economy, has undergone a complete transformation. The way our clothes are made and distributed and thrown away is barely recognizable compared to the way it was done in the \u201990s. And yet our playbook for improving it remains exactly the same. This year, I spoke with more than 30 company reps, factory auditors and researchers and read dozens of studies describing what has happened in those sweatshops since they became a cultural fixation three decades ago. All these sources led me to the same conclusion: Boycotts have failed. Our clothes are being made in ways that advocacy campaigns can\u2019t affect and in places they can\u2019t reach. So how are we going to stop sweatshops now?\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax1_caption\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to a corporate social responsibility conference, you\u2019ve undoubtedly heard the story of the three fire extinguishers. The way it goes is, an inspector was walking through a clothing factory in Bangladesh and noticed that it had three fire extinguishers on the wall, one right on top of the other. He asked why, and the manager of the factory told him, \u201cWe get audited under three different standards, and they each require us to have a fire extinguisher a different distance from the floor. We got tired of moving the fire extinguisher every time an inspector came, so now we just have one at each height.\u201d This is the world that No Logo built. By the end of the \u201990s, a society-wide consensus had formed on how companies should operate their developing-country factories. First, we wanted them to ban all the terrible things we read about in magazines. No more child labor, choked ventilation, abusive bosses, confiscated passports. Companies should apply U.S. working conditions or, at the minimum, follow local laws where they operated. Second, we wanted them to send inspectors to see if those commitments were being met. And most companies did these things. That was the easy part. The hard part, it turned out, is that these structures aren\u2019t designed to make factories take better care of their workers. They\u2019re designed to make factories look like they are. When you hear the word \u201cinspector,\u201d you think of a sort of detective, walking up and down whirring assembly lines, interviewing workers, interrogating managers. In reality, factory audits are primarily a paperwork exercise. Inspectors typically spend one day\u2014two, tops\u2014at each factory, mostly in the back office, checking time sheets for shift lengths, birth certificates for child labor, pay stubs for wages and overtime. In a 2009 survey, Chinese auditors referred to their work as a \u201ccat-and-mouse game.\u201d They updated their inspections to get around the fraud: asking workers their zodiac signs instead of their birthdays, checking for wrinkles on birth certificates. Then the factories updated their fraud to get around the inspections. Auditors tell me of arriving at factories where the owners play a song over the loudspeakers as a signal to shuffle the child laborers out the back. \u201cSometimes [employees] answer before you ask the question,\u201d says Rachelle Jackson, director of sustainability and innovation at Arche Advisors, who estimates she\u2019s done around 1,500 audits. \u201cYou ask, \u2018What time do you start work?\u2019 and they say, \u2018Eight hours.\u2019\u201d Those small-batch, hemp-woven Daisy Dukes you bought in Dumbo are far more likely to be made in a sweatshop than your $7 H&M gym shorts. For his book The Promise and Limits of Private Power, Brown University\u2019s Richard Locke examined 10 years of Nike inspections. Nike was doing two kinds of audits, one mostly based on paperwork and the other incorporating the impressions of its staff after visiting factories. From 2001 to 2005, the paperwork audit showed that working conditions in almost all of Nike\u2019s suppliers were steadily improving. When Locke checked the qualitative audit, though, he found that nearly 80 percent of them either hadn\u2019t improved\u2014or had gotten worse. Partly in response to this dynamic, a lot of the big brands switched tactics, moving from wrist-slapping to worker-training. In 2009, Nike set up a model factory in Sri Lanka and sent managers there from all over the world. Since any change in operations can make suppliers less productive at first, the company signed long-term agreements with factories, pledging to stick with them as they learned how to meet deadlines using better methods and safer equipment rather than longer shifts. But these second-gen practices couldn\u2019t insulate factories from the countries where they operated. The Nike training worked wonders in Mexico, but had no effect in China or Sri Lanka. Between 8 and 10 percent of Mexican workers quit every year. In China, it was that high per month: They were training employees only to send them to other firms. Mexican factories had unions and NGOs telling workers how to take employers to court if they didn\u2019t pay back wages. In China, where labor activism is basically illegal, workers didn\u2019t even know which rights they had, let alone how to exercise them. Nike is Vietnam's biggest employer. In 1996, 12 workers in a Nike factory were hospitalized after their manager made them run around in circles for not wearing the right shoes. The incident sparked worldwide protests. (Photo credit: Steve Raymer/Corbis) Now, I don\u2019t want to give the impression that consumer boycotts were totally useless. Twenty-five years after the movement began, some large suppliers have formalized workforces, provide better health and safety practices and pay above the minimum wage. Ironically, it\u2019s the major brands, the companies that are still the targets of those viral NGO campaigns, which are the most likely to use these factories. The biggest names, after all, have the greatest incentive (and the resources) to defend their reputations. Chikako Oka, a lecturer at Royal Holloway University, found that reputation-conscious companies had 35 percent fewer working violations in their Cambodian factories than did generic brands. Which leads us to the first flaw with our existing model of anti-sweatshop advocacy. It\u2019s not the largest or the second-largest company we should be worried about anymore. It\u2019s the 44th, or the 207th. Those small-batch, hemp-woven Daisy Dukes you bought in Dumbo are far more likely to be made in a sweatshop than your $7 H&M gym shorts. But that\u2019s not the only problem. In the last 25 years, as the big brands were getting (somewhat) better at monitoring their supply chains, the entire global apparatus of manufacturing shifted underneath them.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax2_caption\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. on November 24, 2012, the fire alarm went off on the fourth floor of a nondescript building in the suburbs of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Inside, nearly 1,200 garment workers were on deadline, scrambling to complete an order. When the bells started ringing, they asked if they could leave. Their managers told them to go back to their machines. Five minutes later, the floor filled with black smoke; screams could be heard from below. The building had no sprinklers or fire escapes. Workers tried to flee down an internal staircase, but the exits were locked. Those on the lower floors were trapped by boxes of yarn and clothes that had already been completed. The fire eventually engulfed the building, killing at least 112 people and injuring hundreds more. Some broke their backs and legs jumping from the windows. Most of the workers inside the Tazreen garment factory were making clothing for Western brands: Dickies, Wal-Mart, Disney, all their logos showed up on labels pulled from the rubble. But Tazreen wasn\u2019t yet another example of corporations failing to police conditions in their factories. It was an example of how doing so has become impossible. Inside the Tazreen garment factory after the fire. (Photo credit: Reuters/Corbis) We buy more clothes now, move through trends faster. In the olden days\u2014the early \u201890s\u2014brands produced two to four fashion cycles per year, big orders coordinated by season, planned months in advance. These days, there\u2019s no such thing as cycles, only products. If a shirt is selling well, Wal-Mart orders its suppliers to make more. If headbands inexplicably come into fashion, H&M rushes to make millions of them before they go out again. This flexibility means that factories have to compete on the number of clothing lines they can produce and how quickly they can switch from one to another. Chinese manufacturers that once made four products at a time now make 300. Locke profiles a Honduran supplier that used to have around two months to prepare orders for Western brands\u2014buy fabric, cut T-shirt shapes out of it, sew them together, send them to stores. Now they get one week. In the fast-fashion era, Western brands can\u2019t afford the luxury of working with the same suppliers and ensuring that they meet the company\u2019s standards. And so, rather than manage a giant, respirating network of factories themselves, most of them have outsourced this coordination to megasuppliers: huge conglomerates that can take a design sketch, split the production between thousands of factories, box up the goods and ship them to stores in less time than they\u2019ll stay in style. Manufacturing middlemen aren\u2019t new, of course: Those \u201cNike factories\u201d in Indonesia that Jennifer Love Hewitt marched against were actually run by Taiwanese and Korean firms. What is new, though, is how big the megasuppliers have become and how much of the sector they control. In Sri Lanka, four companies generate roughly 25 percent of the country\u2019s garment income. Yue Yuen, the Foxconn of footwear, makes one-fifth of all the shoes in the world. The largest apparel megasupplier, Li & Fung, which produces everything from Wal-Mart basics to Disney plush toys to Spanx, has revenues of $19.2 billion; more than Ralph Lauren, Armani and Tommy Hilfiger combined. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport calls Li & Fung\u2019s operations \u201cephemeral.\u201d It has 15,000 supplier factories in 40 countries, but doesn\u2019t own or operate any of them. It\u2019s a coordinator, configuring cotton suppliers, textile mills, stitching and sewing houses into a straight line just long enough to deliver one order to one buyer, and then reconfiguring them for the next. Li & Fung does inspect its suppliers and send reports back to its buyers. But there\u2019s no guarantee that orders will be filled by the same factory twice, and audits are often carried out after the order has already been placed. And so clothing companies have no ability or incentive to fix what they find. It's like finding out the results of a restaurant health inspection after you've already eaten your meal. In 2013, The New York Times published a sort of greatest-hits of Li & Fung violations: 29 workers killed in a fire in Bangladesh in 2010; at least two workers killed in a \u201cstampede,\u201d also in Bangladesh, in 2011; 280 workers fainting at a facility in Cambodia due to malnourishment and air contamination; a dozen workers fired in Indonesia, allegedly for trying to start a union. Jeroen Merk, a researcher at the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University Rotterdam\u2014and one of the few academics who\u2019s investigating the megasuppliers\u2014says their business model is deliberately organized to keep buyers separated from factories. If brands discover what factories charge, they might work with them directly and keep the margin for themselves. Some companies ordering clothes through megasuppliers, he says, don\u2019t know which factories they were made in\u2014or even which countries. In many cases, the megasuppliers don\u2019t know either. Last year, a compliance manager for a European brand told NYU\u2019s Center for Business and Human Rights that small factories in Bangladesh, capable of producing just 10,000 pieces per month, were accepting orders 10 times that large and then filling them through agents, small workshops, and home-based workers. Gale Raj-Reichert, a researcher at the University of Manchester who studies electronics supply chains, met a manufacturer in Malaysia who had no idea which company he was producing for. He got his orders and delivered his goods exclusively through middlemen. After the Tazreen fire, NGO campaigns focused on how Wal-Mart was responsible for 60 percent of the clothing being produced there. But Wal-Mart never actually placed an order with Tazreen. In fact, over a year before the fire, Wal-Mart inspected the factory and discovered that it was unsafe. By the time of the fire, it had banned its suppliers from using it. So here\u2019s how its products ended up at Tazreen anyway: Wal-Mart hired a megasupplier called Success Apparel to fill an order for shorts. Success hired another company, Simco, to carry out the work. Simco\u2014without telling Success, much less Wal-Mart\u2014sub-contracted 7 percent of the order to Tazreen\u2019s parent company, the Tuba Group, which then assigned it to Tazreen. Two other sub- (or sub-sub-sub-) contractors also placed Wal-Mart orders at Tazreen, also without telling the company. It was the same with many of the other brands whose labels were found in Tazreen: They either didn\u2019t know their clothes were being produced there or had explicitly banned the factory as a supplier. Those companies now say that, because the orders violated their policies, they\u2019re not obligated to compensate victims. It\u2019s tempting to think that we can do something about this. Boycott the companies that use megasuppliers, maybe. Last year, partly over concerns about sub-contracting, Wal-Mart \u201cin-sourced\u201d its production back from Li & Fung and started coordinating its own network of suppliers. But the Wal-Marts of the world can\u2019t magically un-link themselves from the pressures of global supply and demand. Instead, companies that in-source production just become their own megasuppliers. Subcontractors can still deceive auditors or farm out orders without telling Wal-Mart. For smaller companies, the ones NGOs aren\u2019t watching, in-sourcing isn\u2019t even an option. And besides, going after the megasuppliers just moves the tired name-and-shame routine one layer down. Auditors tell me Li & Fung, just like the companies it sells to, has good factories and bad ones. As it grows, it is finding reasons to defend its public reputation\u2014it is still the only company that has directly paid compensation to the victims of Tazreen. The worst conditions probably aren\u2019t in Li & Fung factories, but in the ones a few billion in revenue down the rankings. In Cambodia, a group of South Korean intermediaries, all of them with names you\u2019ve never heard, are backing a lawsuit against their own workers, demanding that they pay back $200 million in revenue the companies lost during a strike. Consumers\u2019 power, to the extent we had any, depended on brands forcing their supply chains to do better. Now they\u2014and we\u2014are losing that power. And that\u2019s still not the worst of it. The really atrocious violations, the ones most likely to proliferate, are in places where we have no influence at all.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax3_caption\n\nIn Delhi\u2019s garment cluster, \u201cchildren start learning the job at the age of 8,\u201d writes the University of London\u2019s Alessandra Mezzadri. \u201cThey master it by the age of 12.\u201d She calls the area a \u201ccomposite sweatshop\u201d: For every tailor working in a factory, there are several employed in homes, workshops or backyards. Around 80 percent of the workers are informal \u2014 mostly migrants, some of them trafficked, hired and fired as orders are commissioned and completed, divvied out by brokers, paid a few cents for each piece of clothing they deliver. The children get paid half as much as the adults. During her fieldwork, she found kids sitting on apartment floors, sewing and cutting, often under the supervision of their parents. Vignettes like these are usually invoked to condemn us for our own complicity in these wages, these workshops. Delhi\u2019s garment workers aren\u2019t producing clothes for export, though. They\u2019re sewing saris and embroidering clothes destined for Indian and Bangladeshi and Pakistani shelves, not Western ones. This, Mezzadri told me, is \u201cwhy child labor persists.\u201d Factories in developing countries that send clothes to export markets need to at least look like they\u2019re complying with social standards. For domestic markets, they don\u2019t. Maybe even more than the other reasons I\u2019ve outlined, this is why consumer advocacy campaigns are never going to improve working conditions in the developing world: Western markets simply don\u2019t matter as much as they used to. India produces twice as much clothing for its own consumers as it does for us. Fifty-six percent of the clothing produced in China is for the Chinese market. Both of those numbers are only going to grow. And it\u2019s not just developing countries selling stuff to themselves. They\u2019re also selling a rapidly expanding share to each other. From 2008 to 2013, the fastest-growing demand for apparel was in China, Eastern Europe, India, Turkey and Brazil. Garment exports from Bangladesh to other poor countries have grown by as much as 50 percent per year. Rich countries make up just one-tenth of the world\u2019s population. In the next 15 years, their share of consumption is expected to fall from 64 percent to 30 percent. Most of the 1.2 billion people the global economy added to the middle class in the last 15 years earn between $2 and $13 per day. \u201cThe nature of demand will be for cheap, undifferentiated goods,\u201d says a World Bank report\u2014exactly the kinds of products that are most likely to be made in supply chains with low or nonexistent labor standards. This shift is already eroding the meager gains we\u2019ve made protecting labor conditions and the environment in poor countries. The timber sector in Gabon, for example, used to specialize in high-quality, processed lumber for European customers. Exporting to OECD countries meant that all the wood had to comply with local labor laws and Forestry Code guidelines on sustainability and biodiversity. By 2007, however, the sector was selling 80 percent of its timber to China and India. Exporters shifted to selling unprocessed logs, which generate less profit and create one-quarter as many jobs as plywood. Since they now compete on quantity, rather than quality, they cut down three times as many trees to make the same revenue. Their new buyers don\u2019t require environmental and labor certifications, so they\u2019ve fallen away. It\u2019s the same in Burma. In the two years after its military dictatorship uncorked in 2011, $40 billion in foreign investment poured in. Most of it came from Chinese, Malaysian, Singaporean and Thai companies; as of 2013, the United States was only the ninth largest investor. The results are about what you would expect. Earlier this year, more than 2,000 Burmese workers marched in protest outside a factory producing for E-Land, the South Korean-owned conglomerate that is now the largest women\u2019s-apparel retailer in China. The workers were demanding a raise from $1 per day. The factory was in a special economic zone; the workers were arrested on the pretext that they didn\u2019t have a permit for the demonstration. This February, Burmese workers went on strike against Tai Yee, a Chinese-owned footwear factory. (Photo credit: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP) Asian companies investing in Burma aren\u2019t run by worse or greedier people than ours are. They\u2019re just operating under a different risk calculus. American firms putting more than $500,000 into the country are required to publicly report their land acquisitions, payments to local officials, and security arrangements. If they get busted doing something heinous, they\u2019ll end up on front pages. Developing-country multinationals don\u2019t have these pressures. The standard response here is that, as Chinese consumers get richer, they, too, will start demanding pesticide-free apples, cruelty-free jeans, dolphin-free tuna. And indeed, China has passed tons of legislation the past few years to improve working conditions and even requires reporting by its companies abroad. But pointing to these small (and un-enforced) steps ignores other countries that have climbed up the income ladder and haven\u2019t brought social concerns with them. There have been no major consumer movements in Hong Kong against Li & Fung. South Korea has the same per capita GDP as New Zealand, but has shown no interest in regulating its companies abroad. Khalid Nadvi, a professor at the University of Manchester, says there have been no cases of Chinese consumers agitating over foreign working conditions. \u201cThe emerging middle class in China is first and second generation,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of them worked in the kinds of factories we\u2019re advocating to improve.\u201d As more and more of the world\u2019s economy takes place without us, we need to change the way we think about going after sweatshops. There\u2019s only one idea I\u2019ve heard that has the potential to address the flawed audits, the opaque megasuppliers and the changes in global consumption all at once.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax4_caption\n\nNot so long ago, the laborers in Brazil who made pig-iron, an essential ingredient in stainless steel, lived in hopelessly grim conditions. They would set up in a clearing in the Amazonian rainforest, burn the trees to charcoal, sell it to smelters, then move to another clearing and start over. They tended 1000-degree furnaces barefoot, earning wages just low enough to keep them trapped in a cycle of debt to their employer or a labor broker. The furnaces were small-scale, informal, everywhere. A Brazilian labor inspector told a researcher in 2004, \u201cI saw cattle living in better conditions than the workers.\u201d Penalizing the furnaces wasn\u2019t an option: Brazil produced millions of tons of pig iron every year like this. Busting a single operator, or even dozens, would only add fines to the cost of doing business. Instead, the inspectors got creative. Working with public prosecutors, they unearthed an obscure judicial statement that prohibited companies from outsourcing their \u201ccore\u201d activities. They told the smelters, the ones buying the charcoal, that from now on it was their responsibility to make sure furnaces weren\u2019t employing forced labor. Inspectors went up the chain too, convincing the country\u2019s largest iron-ore company to sell only to smelters that could prove their charcoal came from replanted forests and not illegal first-growth timber. They worked with state-run banks to cut off smelters from subsidized credit for two years if they didn\u2019t closely monitor their suppliers. Suddenly, the smelters were responsible for ensuring that their raw material was produced under decent conditions. They founded an industry-wide auditing body and started sending quality experts and auditors out in pickups to check on the furnaces. By 2009, the percentage of charcoal made from illegal timber had dropped from 60 percent to 30 percent. Workers were signing contracts and earning higher wages. Furnaces were cooperating with smelters to produce higher-grade iron. All of this, it should be obvious by now, would have been impossible for private auditors. Most of that pig-iron was being bought by foreign car companies. Sure, they could have done more inspections, delivered some training, or threatened to pull orders. But encouraging smelters to move into higher-grade, more profitable exports would have been directly against the car companies\u2019 interests. Yet this is how we expect to bring about better labor conditions in poor countries. Instead of empowering domestic agencies with a mandate to prevent abuses, we rely on international corporations seeking to insulate themselves from bad publicity. Nearly all of the horror stories that show up in consumer campaigns are illegal in the countries where they take place. These countries simply don\u2019t have anyone to enforce the laws. Bangladesh has just 125 labor inspectors for 75 million workers. Cambodian inspectors, on average, earn less than half as much as the garment workers whose conditions they\u2019re supposed to be safeguarding. Uganda, with 40 million people, has only 120 practitioners capable of carrying out environmental impact assessments. In Burma, regional governments have received more than 6,000 complaints related to land revocations, but have investigated fewer than 300 of them. That\u2019s why Brazil is so startling. It has 10,000 public prosecutors and 3,000 inspectors, all making monthly salaries of at least $5,000. The inspectors collaborate with other government agencies, workers, unions and NGOs, not just to find the most outrageous violations, but to actually fix them. NYU\u2019s Salo Coslovsky, from whom I stole the pig-iron example, says Brazilian inspectors act more like McKinsey consultants than cops. Just as schoolteachers don\u2019t enforce every rule every time it\u2019s broken, he says, inspectors are allowed to overlook minor transgressions (making workers stay late to get an order completed) to solve bigger ones (outdated machinery, dangerous buildings, systematic discrimination). When inspectors wanted to reduce child labor, they convened parents, schools, and farms, created maps of the areas where the worst abuses were likely to happen, and dispatched vans full of auditors to prevent them. When public prosecutors wanted to keep shrimp farms from polluting the shore, they worked with three separate government agencies to relocate farmers away from riverbanks. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of regulatory acupuncture,\u201d says Roberto Pires, a researcher at the Institute for Applied Economic Research, a think tank in Bras\u00edlia, \u201cfinding the specific points where applying pressure can provoke systemic effects.\u201d In another case, inspectors found that auto-parts manufacturers were using outdated metal-stamping machines. Those factories were responsible for almost half the country\u2019s industrial accidents, including hand, arm and finger amputations. Inspectors couldn\u2019t make factory owners buy new machines\u2014that would have cost millions of dollars. So they worked with a health and safety think tank, as well as state banks, to retrofit the existing machines. Two years later, accidents across the industry had fallen by 66 percent. All this discretion and autonomy, these cowboy inspectors roaming the countryside, sounds like an invitation for corruption. But everyone I speak with says it\u2019s far less of a problem than you\u2019d think. That\u2019s in part because the inspectors are required to do far more than just complete a certain number of investigations per month. Instead, they write qualitative summaries of which worksites they\u2019ve visited, what problems they\u2019ve found and what they\u2019re doing to address them. Listening to consumer advocacy campaigns, you\u2019d think our only influence on the developing world is at the cash register. This process wasn\u2019t easy in Brazil, and it won\u2019t be anywhere else. Brazil\u2019s inspectorate spent more than 30 years justifying its existence. Its farms and factories are not nice places to work in by any absolute definition of the term, and will not be for a long time. The corruption and inefficiency of developing country governments can\u2019t be solved simply with more employees. But going around these governments won\u2019t solve any problems either. One theory on why last year\u2019s Ebola outbreak was so bad is that local hospitals, after years of being bypassed by international NGOs, didn't have the training or equipment they needed to treat their own communities. For decades, we\u2019ve been doing the same thing with factories. In the \u201990s, while we were telling Western companies to audit their suppliers, the World Bank was telling them that government inspectors didn\u2019t need to anymore. Listening to consumer advocacy campaigns, you\u2019d think our only influence on the developing world was at the cash register. But our real leverage is with our policies, not our purchases. In the '90s, the U.S. told Cambodia that to sell its clothes here, it had to open up every single garment factory to International Labor Organization inspections. Trade agreements require developing countries to establish huge intellectual-property inspection bodies to raid markets for bootleg Blu-rays. We just need to offer poor workers the same kinds of protection we give pharmaceutical patents. As for Western companies, we shouldn\u2019t let them off the hook. But let\u2019s be clear: All of those emerging-market multinationals that South Korea and China are sending abroad have operations in the United States, too. Foxconn has a factory in Indiana. It is not a sweatshop. That isn\u2019t because Foxconn carries out such great audits or offers entrepreneurship classes. It\u2019s because it is located in a country with functioning institutions. We are not going to shop ourselves into a better world. Advocating for boring stuff like complaint mechanisms and formalized labor contracts is nowhere near as satisfying as buying a pair of Fair Trade sandals or whatever. But that\u2019s how the hard work of development actually gets done: Not by imploring people to buy better, but by giving them no other option. After all, that naked protest of Old Navy in the '90s? Behind the 50 demonstrators, a line of 300 customers stretched\n\naround the block."

			"text": "Ji Sub Jeong/HuffPost\n\nAndrea spent a recent 13-hour shift at Starbucks, where she works as a manager, in agony. The 52-year-old, who asked that her real name and location not appear in this story for fear of losing her job, had opened the store at 5:15 a.m. and was supposed to leave at 1:45 p.m. But then she had to cover for an employee who went home sick. An hour into her shift, she started to feel the familiar sharp sensation that shoots up from her feet to her back whenever she stands for prolonged periods. A few hours later, she began to limp. Andrea has a health condition that she didn\u2019t want to specify, to protect her anonymity. She ignored the severe pain as she took drive-thru orders and made sure the coffee bar was running smoothly. In the past four years, Andrea has applied for 29 jobs within Starbucks, in areas like human resources and recruiting, that would allow her to spend less time on her feet. She\u2019s been rejected from all of them, and only once landed an interview, even though she\u2019s been with the company for 15 years, was voted manager of the quarter for her district in 2016 and earned a degree through the Starbucks scholarship program at Arizona State University. At first, Andrea thought she simply needed to further develop her management skills and put in more face time with the regional head office. But over the past two years, as she\u2019s watched several of her colleagues over age 40 be fired or suddenly leave the company, she\u2019s begun to suspect a more sinister reason for her repeated rejections. Every time she receives the same corporate rejection letter stating that they decided to \u201cgo in another direction,\u201d she thinks: \u201cAm I a liability to them at this point with my health or with my age?\u201d Andrea\u2019s started to feel like her days at the company are numbered. Though she\u2019s taken time off to have multiple surgeries, she never complains about her pain at work, worried that doing so could get her fired. \u201cI\u2019m scared going to work every day that they are going to find some reason to let me go,\u201d she told HuffPost. While her annual salary of around $71,000 is high for a service industry job, she\u2019s a single mom who still lives paycheck to paycheck, supporting herself and her 23-year-old daughter who lives at home and has a neurological condition. Andrea estimates she spends between $200 and $400 a month on their medical expenses. \u201cI would go bankrupt in less than six months, I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nMark Makela via Getty Images Protesters demonstrate in a Philadelphia Starbucks on April 15, 2018, days after an employee at a Starbucks in that city called the police to report two black men waiting to meet a friend.\n\nStarbucks has recently been in the headlines for requiring its staff to undergo racial bias training, after two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia store in April while waiting for a friend. But some employees say there\u2019s another bias the company needs to address: age discrimination. HuffPost spoke with seven current and former managers of Starbucks-owned stores in five states who say they were bullied by management and, in most cases, were either fired or pushed out of the company for being over age 40. While Starbucks is often held up as a enviable workplace, where employees are called \u201cpartners\u201d and receive stock options, a generous benefits package and free online college tuition, older staff members say the company is increasingly treating employees as disposable. They say that in the past five years, Starbucks has seemed intent on replacing older managers with younger, lower-paid workers who will tough out long shifts, take on greater workloads and cost less to insure. Most of the people HuffPost interviewed had worked at the company for more than 10 years, and described similar patterns of being unfairly criticized at work, passed over for promotions, given fewer responsibilities over time and ultimately being forced out or let go for reasons that were at odds with their high performance. The situations range from an employee who said her manager made age-related comments to others who said managers fixated on their injuries, attacked their work and ostracized them. Several said they complained to human resources, but that internal investigations were not done thoroughly and resulted in no apparent consequences for discriminatory managers. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for any sort of harassment of any kind and have a very clear set of guidelines when any type of harassment or discrimination claims like this are made,\u201d said Reggie Borges, a spokesman for Starbucks, adding that the company can\u2019t comment on specific cases. \u201cWe want our stores to be a welcoming environment for our partners and our customers and in any instance where that is not the case, we want to take swift action and address it.\u201d One employee told HuffPost she\u2019s filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging she was fired because of age discrimination, and says she plans to pursue a lawsuit if the company doesn\u2019t agree to mediation. Another former employee, Diana Kelly, recently hired a lawyer and plans to file an EEOC complaint for wrongful termination based on ageism. The company has faced accusations of age-related discrimination before. In 2013, a 65-year-old former barista filed a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights after she was fired and replaced with two workers in their 20s. Starbucks told the community news site Gazette.net there was \u201cno factual basis\u201d to the woman\u2019s claims. In 2015, a 63-year-old former Starbucks manager sued the company for wrongful termination based on ageism. The company settled. \u201cThe biggest betrayal is \u2018respect and dignity to every partner,\u2019\u201d said Kelly, paraphrasing part of the company\u2019s mission statement. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like that has turned out to be true for the older people.\u201d \u2018One down, three to go\u2019 Candice, a 42-year-old former Starbucks store manager in Orlando, Florida, filed a complaint with the EEOC after she was fired in March. Candice asked that HuffPost not publish her last name, to avoid jeopardizing her current job search. She says she injured her back on the job last May, carrying 20 pounds or so of coffee. She took a brief medical leave, and when she stopped by the store almost two weeks after the injury, Candice\u2019s boss handed her a \u201ccorrective action,\u201d a document that listed issues with her performance. Her manager claimed she had failed to properly fill out the shift schedule \u2015 though Candice said she hadn\u2019t been informed of a new protocol \u2015 and the cleaning schedule. Candice says she kept diligent cleaning records, which her manager had not audited or signed for over three months, despite protocol that her boss do so at least every six weeks. (HuffPost reviewed the cleaning logs in question, and it does appear that her boss had not signed them for several months.)\n\nMike Blake / Reuters A Starbucks location in Fountain Valley, California.\n\nCandice, who worked for the company during two different periods for a total of eight years, was shocked to receive the corrective action, which she says is usually reserved for employees on the path to being fired. Her manager had never given her a verbal warning, which she says is usually the first step for low-level performance issues. (Borges said the type of corrective action an employee receives \u2015 verbal, written or final \u2015 depends on \u201cthe severity and nature of the infraction.\u201d) Candice ran a high-earning store, had recently been cited by senior management as an exemplary leader in an email to all stores in the Florida region, and was beloved by many of her customers and employees. In an email to human resources that HuffPost reviewed, one colleague described Candice as a \u201cmentor\u201d and \u201cthe best Starbucks Manager I have ever had.\u201d Candice was so panicked about the prospect of being fired from a job she loved, and losing the salary her family of five depended on, that she lied to her doctor about feeling better and cut her medical leave short. \u201cI told my husband \u2018If I don\u2019t go to work tomorrow, I\u2019m going to lose my job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt never felt like there was a real performance issue or anything out there I had missed. I really felt like I was a target immediately.\u201d When Candice returned to work, what she now sees as age discrimination became worse. Her district manager, a woman in her early or mid-30s who started the job in 2016, began showing up to the store to complain that it was dirty and disorganized. Candice says that was untrue, and HuffPost reviewed a document that showed her store scored a 96.8 percent on the company\u2019s quality control inspection in June. Every six weeks, her boss would send out a survey asking employees to rate Candice\u2019s performance, according to a former barista at the store who asked not to be named in this story. The former employee added that it felt like their district manager was trying to \u201cfind some reason she could use to fire\u201d Candice. Candice says her manager also began making comments suggesting she was unfit to manage a store because of her injury and the fact that she was raising three sons. She felt like the comments were due to her age. \u201cI never thought I was old,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked really hard for 12-hour days and actually felt I had more stamina than 20-year-olds.\u201d A colleague told Candice that when a woman over 50 from their district was demoted in July, their boss said \u201cOne down, three to go\u201d \u2015 a reference to Candice and two other store managers over 40 in their district. (The colleague would not comment for this article because they still work at Starbucks and are concerned about job security, but HuffPost reviewed a text message that confirmed the colleague had reported the comment to an internal investigator.) Candice felt like she could be fired any day. The stress turned her into a \u201czombie\u201d who would come home from work and go straight to her room. Her husband said she had anxiety attacks that made her hands shake and her head dizzy. \u201cI felt really bullied and harassed all the time,\u201d Candice said. \u201c[My manager] would always find something to put me down, and I would literally come out of work in tears or extremely sad. She had so much power over me, and it became a fight for my job and a fight for me and my integrity.\u201d Candice called HR to complain about her boss\u2019 behavior three months after her injury, and says she was told another employee had also complained about this particular district manager. The company conducted an investigation. Candice says the investigator concluded that her boss had made the \u201cOne down, three to go\u201d comment, which another employee had verified, and said that the manager \u201cneeds coaching on how to address partners\u201d \u2015 but Candice says she didn\u2019t witness any consequences. In March, Candice was fired after her boss claimed she failed to meet a \u201cperformance improvement plan.\u201d Candice says she was replaced with a younger employee. Covering up ageism Legal experts say age discrimination in the workplace is common but hard to prove. Walker Harman Jr., a New York-based lawyer who specializes in employment law, says roughly half of his cases involve discrimination based on age or disability. It\u2019s most common in jobs where employees are visible to the public, like in the service or retail industries, and at companies that want to project a young, hip image. Unlike other forms of discrimination, employers have many ways of masking ageism. \u201cOnly infrequently do we get a case where someone has said \u2018We gotta get rid of this old man\u2019 or \u2018You should retire\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re too old to use a smartphone,\u2019\u201d said Harman. \u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s much more subtle and there were no overt statements made. The person was just terminated and replaced with a much younger person.\u201d Harman says management often invents or exaggerates performance issues to obscure ageism. \u201c[Companies] have all these code of conduct things they have to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually some young boss comes in and does not like working with the older person who has been around forever and finds any way to get rid of them as a technical matter.\u201d\n\nWe kept getting more and more work and less and less time. Angela Gustavson, former Starbucks store manager\n\nA soon-to-be-released survey from the AARP found that 61 percent of people over 45 say they have experienced or observed age discrimination at work. Laurie McCann, a senior attorney for the AARP, said one potential sign of age discrimination is when an older, high-performing employee suddenly gets bad performance reviews. \u201cIt seems remarkable that someone was a stellar employee only to become a horrible employee,\u201d she said. \u201cThat type of evidence can be helpful.\u201d Kelly, a former district manager who oversaw 12 Starbucks stores in northern Virginia, found out she had been fired last October. Kelly\u2019s stores consistently ranked in the top five for her region, which she says includes roughly 600 stores, in customer service, low turnover and cleanliness. The 60-year-old was let go suddenly, after her manager found a two-year-old photo of Kelly and other employees holding unopened bottles of wine at a colleague\u2019s going-away party, which had been held at a Starbucks. Kelly was looking into alcohol-related claims involving other employees when her manager asked if she knew of any other incidents involving alcohol in her district. Kelly couldn\u2019t recall any, but a few days later, her manager showed her the photo. Kelly hadn\u2019t considered the going-away party a policy violation. For one, she says the wine bottles were gifts that nobody drank at the store. The party was also held at 8 p.m., and though the store was still open, none of the employees who attended the party, including her, were working. (HuffPost reviewed a statement by the colleague the party was celebrating that corroborated those details and also noted that Kelly hadn\u2019t brought any alcohol to the store herself or known that others would be doing so.) The company policy, which HuffPost reviewed, specifies that alcohol is forbidden \u201con company premises, while conducting company business or during working time.\u201d Kelly\u2019s understanding was that if an employee wasn\u2019t on company time, they could have a closed bottle of alcohol in a store; in 2016, for example, she was at another going-away party where employees gave a former manager wine without punishment. (A current Starbucks employee corroborated her account of that event, and added that in December, they witnessed a similar situation.) But Kelly says her boss told her that as a district manager, she was \u201calways on the clock.\u201d Borges said the company couldn\u2019t comment on Kelly\u2019s specific case, but that Starbucks\u2019 policy makes it \u201cvery clear you are not allowed to have alcohol on company premises, full stop.\u201d Kelly thinks her boss saw the photo as an excuse to let her go. \u201cI felt like it was a gift, like \u2018Wow, we finally have something on her,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that she was the oldest member of her team. \u201cI was on the higher end in terms of pay, and I think that had a lot to do with it.\u201d While she said she might have handled the going-away party differently in hindsight, she doesn\u2019t think she deserved to be fired for a two-year-old violation of an unclear company rule. Throughout her career at Starbucks, Kelly says, various bosses had promised her a promotion from district manager to regional manager. She even moved away from her family for six months to work on a project at the company\u2019s support center in Seattle. She says management had told her this would be a steppingstone to higher positions. But Kelly kept watching that role go to younger employees. In 2012, she says, a senior manager told her an \u201cintangible\u201d might be standing in the way of her getting promoted. She started to suspect her age was the reason when, in 2016, her 34-year-old boss started stripping away her responsibilities, such as training new employees. Kelly became confident age discrimination was at play last summer, when the regional vice president told her she could not start an official company community group for older Starbucks staff, like the groups that exist for female, black, LGBTQ, veteran and sustainability-minded staff. Her firing came as a shock. After being let go from a company she had served for 13 years, she \u201cfelt totally destroyed and totally betrayed.\u201d Profit over people Current and former Starbucks employees told HuffPost they feel age discrimination is the byproduct of a larger company shift from valuing staff to treating them as replaceable worker bees. In the last five years, Kelly said, the company has focused on programs to streamline duties and specify the exact tasks employees should be doing during their shifts, how long they should take and how often they should be repeated. The company that once had a reputation for putting employees first was now prioritizing efficiency and profit. \u201cI have never heard the words \u2018quality of life\u2019 in so many years now, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cThe pendulum has swung from one extreme to the other.\u201d In 2016, a Starbucks employee in California made headlines after starting a petition on Coworker.org, a platform for grassroots workplace campaigns, about labor issues, which resulted in a number of articles about chronic understaffing within the company. The following year, 89 percent of Starbucks workers said staffing was still an issue.\n\nDavid Ryder / Reuters Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks during the company's 2014 shareholders meeting in Seattle."

			"text": "President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. will withdraw from the international nuclear accord with Iran, the landmark 2015 agreement curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear development program in return for sanctions relief. By ending America\u2019s participation in the deal, Trump fulfills a major campaign promise. But the decision could set the stage for an international political crisis and uncertainty over the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the agreement: The Deal Also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal is the result of a decade of international negotiations to curb Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Although Iran is banned from possessing nuclear weapons as a state party of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it failed to disclose the existence of its uranium-enrichment program for 18 years, causing alarm when its clandestine program was revealed in 2003. Negotiators from Iran and six other world powers, including the United Nations Security Council\u2019s five permanent members and Germany, reached the historic agreement on July 14, 2015. It placed strict limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program that were set to last for more than a decade. The United Nations Security Council endorsed the deal on July 20, 2015, officially agreeing to \u201cterminate\u201d U.N. sanctions on Iran.\n\nDanish Siddiqui / Reuters Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with Muslim leaders and scholars in Hyderabad, India, February 15, 2018.\n\nThe JCPOA was a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity,\u201d then-President Barack Obama said at the time it was agreed. \u201cThis is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon,\u201d Obama added. Tehran had always maintained that its nuclear development was only intended for energy and other peaceful purposes, but fears the Islamic Republic was working on developing a nuclear bomb had been rising in the West. Critics of the agreement, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, argued that the deal at its core was not tough enough on Iran. \u201cNot a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that [Iran builds] illicitly,\u201d Netanyahu said in 2015. \u201cThousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That\u2019s a very bad deal.\u201d Trump has echoed these concerns, repeatedly calling it \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d\n\nKEVIN LAMARQUE via Getty Images\n\nWhat It Does At its most basic level, the deal meant Iran agreed to put heavy restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for world powers lifting economic sanctions that target the country. The deal lasts until 2030, with some restrictions expiring before then and other inspection measures extending years beyond that date. Prior to the agreement, international sanctions and trade embargoes had cost the Iranian economy tens of billions of dollars. Iran stood to benefit from a potential increase in foreign investment and access to the Swift international banking system. In return, the rest of the parties to the agreement believed they had security that Iran was always at least a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon during the time that the deal was enforced. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to remove or reduce many of the components needed to create nuclear weapons. The country accepted a 98 percent reduction of its uranium stockpile, the removal of a reactor core used to make plutonium at the Arak heavy water plant and the reduction of thousands of centrifuges needed to enrich uranium. Iran also agreed to limit its research and development work, as well as several other restrictions. The deal contained strict rules on monitoring and inspection of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency was required to extensively monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, and IAEA workers had access to a live video stream of areas including Iranian uranium enrichment plants. Inspectors also have wide-ranging access to sites within the country that they deem necessary to investigate. While conducting this monitoring and inspection regime, the IAEA confirmed nine times that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images"

			"text": "But a year later, West Mosul lies abandoned, ruined and apocalyptic. Walls that remain standing are riddled with holes from mortar fire and bullets. The streets are eerily quiet: hundreds of thousands of former residents of the city are living in camps or nearby communities because there is nothing for them to go back to. Reeking corpses still litter the ruins, awaiting collection.\n\nYou\u2019d think, therefore, that nothing could be more important in this situation than trying to make sure that violent extremism can never return to Mosul. You\u2019d expect that rebuilding a city that was an icon of diversity, peaceful coexistence and cultural heritage would be a top priority. You\u2019d imagine that the streets of West Mosul would be crammed with reconstruction equipment, de-miners, architects, planners, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations and world heritage experts providing technical assistance to Iraq on a master plan for the reconstruction of the city.\n\nIf we\u2019ve learned anything from the last decade in the Middle East and Afghanistan, it is that if a military \u201cwin\u201d is not followed by effective help to ensure stability, then the cycle of violence only continues.\n\nMuch of East Mosul was spared, but the West still lies in ruins a year after the end of the fighting. As I stood there, it felt as if the guns fell silent only yesterday.\n\nThe largest and longest urban battle fought anywhere in the world since World War II was waged to retake Mosul from ISIS. Liberty came at a horrific price: Thousands of civilians were killed and large swathes of the Iraqi city were reduced to rubble.\n\nIn streets that look entirely uninhabitable, small numbers of shell-shocked families are clearing the rubble of their homes with their bare hands, braving the concealed explosives left behind. In the last week, there was an explosion in a house that killed and injured 27 people.\n\nEven worse than the physical ruin of the city is the invisible damage to the emotional landscape of its people. Returning residents have lost homes their families lived in for generations, their possessions, their savings, even the documents that prove their identity. Communities of different faiths who used to live side by side have been thrust apart and are now divided.\n\nA man who approached me described with tears in his eyes how he was lashed by militants. A child told me about seeing a man killed in front of her on the street. A mother and father described the morning when a mortar shell struck their teenage daughter, ripping away her legs, leaving shattered bones protruding. They carried her to a hospital and begged for medical treatment. They were turned away, and she bled to death in their arms.\n\nInjustice and suffering of this magnitude is impossible to quantify. For the people who survived these experiences to have been left on their own and largely forgotten feels utterly wrong and profoundly disquieting. The gap between what they deserve and how quickly the world has forgotten them is shocking.\n\nI found myself asking whether, at another time in history, we would have reacted differently to what happened in Mosul. Would we have reacted as we did after the liberation of Europe after World War II, flooding it with assistance to rebuild and recover?\n\nI thought also of the survivors of the chemical weapons attacks, the hospital bombings, the organized rape and the deliberate starvation of civilians that are all features of contemporary conflicts, and asked myself, have we become numb to human suffering? Are we so doubtful of our ability to act effectively overseas, in light of recent history, that we have begun tolerating the intolerable? Are we guilty of performing a form of collective moral triage, selectively choosing when and where we will defend human rights, for how long and to what degree?\n\nIn Mosul, I felt I was standing at a ground zero of foreign policy failures over the last decade. But also in a place that represents the human capacity for survival and renewal, and the stubborn endurance of universal values in individual hearts.\n\nI think of a father I met, and his joy that his two young daughters are now able to go to school again. Penniless and without a roof over his family\u2019s heads, he spoke as if he had no more treasured possession than their report cards. There would be no more profound symbol of victory than every girl in Mosul being able to go back to school and excel.\n\nNot a single family I met in West Mosul asked me for anything. They are not counting on our assistance. Mosul can trace its history back 3,000 years \u2015 I am sure its people will overcome those three years of terror. But how much better it would be if we saw their recovery as our joint endeavor, in the same way that we regarded the defeat of ISIS as a collective responsibility.\n\nAngelina Jolie is the special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, co-founder of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative and a filmmaker."

How much you eat over the course of a few days or week, however, can result in weight gain.\n\nTo find out more about how long (and how much food) it takes to gain weight, The Huffington Post Australia spoke to two accredited practising dietitians.\n\n\"Weight gain simply happens when we have an imbalance between the kilojoules we're eating and the kilojoules we're burning off,\" Jemma O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia. \"It doesn't occur just from one meal -- it's when this imbalance occurs over a period of time that weight gain can creep up on us.\"\n\nTo put even more simply, Geraldine Georgeou says that \"weight gain occurs when we don't burn off the calories we consume\".\n\nWhen it comes to getting the right balance, one meal can't ruin your weight loss efforts.\n\n\n\nThe key is to enjoy all foods in the right balance, keep your portions lean and focus on eating mindfully and intuitively. Jemma O'Hanlon\n\nAs with anything related to the body, the amount of food we need to eat before it ends up as body weight depends on the individual.\n\n\"The body is constantly working and using energy to complete tasks automatically without thinking, such as breathing,\" Georgeou told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"The calories each person burns to keep our bodies going even at rest is known as our basal metabolic rate. Each person has their own energy requirement which varies depending on numerous factors such as age, height, illness and activity.\n\n\"What also varies is the rate at which people can burn their calories, otherwise known as your metabolism. We also use energy in order to complete conscious tasks such as walking, lifting and talking.\"\n\nOn top of this, the body then uses up energy when we exercise, meaning the more exercise you do the more energy you will burn off.\n\n\"When you stay the same weight, the energy your body gets from food equals the energy you burn off through automatic and conscious activity,\" Georgeou said. \"Don't forget about incidental exercise. All the daily activities we complete like walking to the train station, taking the stairs or even doing household chores will add up.\"\n\nGetty\n\nBut how much extra food equates to one kilogram of weight gain?\n\n\"If we're eating more kilojoules than our bodies are burning, the leftover energy will be stored as body fat,\" O'Hanlon said.\n\n\"One kilogram of fat is 37,000 kilojoules stored (as fat contains 37 kilojoules per gram, which equals 37,000 kilojoules per kilogram). To gain 0.5-1 kilogram per week, you'd need to be consuming roughly an extra 2000-4000 kilojoules each day.\"\n\nIn calories, this equates to an additional 500 plus calories per day that our body doesn't burn off, which isn't much at all.\n\n\"In food terms, that's roughly equivalent to two slices of pizza or two iced doughnuts,\" Georgeou said. \"It doesn't take much to eat over your energy requirement.\"\n\nJordan Siemens Why is it always the most delicious foods? Sigh.\n\nOther foods that add up to around 2000 kilojoules/500 calories include:\n\nOne Four 'N Twenty classic meat pie = 1680kJ\n\nOne Big Mac from McDonald's = 2060kJ\n\nOne Double Quarter Pounder from McDonald's = 3570kJ\n\nOne large signature iced coffee from Gloria Jeans = 1720kJ\n\nOne Zinger stacker burger from KFC = 3013kJ\n\nLarge seasoned chips from KFC = 2070kJ\n\nOne Banana coconut muffin from Muffin Break = 2340kJ\n\n\"Also to note, the average Australian adult consumes about 8,700 kilojoules a day, so some of these single items would be contributing to more than one-third of their daily intake,\" O'Hanlon said.\n\nIt's often when we eat past the point of being full that we're likely to gain weight. Jemma O'Hanlon\n\nWhile the actual rate people can gain weight varies and depends on the individual and their metabolism, age, height, fitness and state of health, it does not happen overnight.\n\n\"When it comes to getting the right balance, one meal can't ruin your weight loss efforts,\" O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia. \"The key is to enjoy all foods in the right balance, keep your portions lean and focus on eating mindfully and intuitively.\n\n\"It's often when we eat past the point of being full that we're likely to gain weight. Eat slowly and listen to your body, and stop when you feel comfortably satisfied. If you're eating until you're stuffed full, chances are you're eating more than your body needs.\"\n\nJae Rew Ah, the all too familiar pants dance.\n\nIf you have weighed yourself at one time of the day and noticed your weight has increased a few hours later, O'Hanlon says this is not the result of 'instant weight gain'.\n\n\"We need to keep in mind that throughout the day our weight can fluctuate by a couple of kilos depending on our hydration levels or water retention, or whether we've just had a meal or something to drink,\" she explained.\n\nThis food or drink will first be digested, the waste excreted (to put it politely) and the excess energy stored as fat.\n\n\"As we start to digest our food our bodies will use this as energy,\" Georgeou said. \"On average, it takes us roughly 6-8 hours after eating for food to travel through our stomach and small intestine. The food then travels through the large intestine where further digestion and absorption of water occurs, before it is then eliminated from the body.\n\n\"However, if we eat a meal with excess calories than we need -- our bodies will store this extra energy as fat to be used at a later time.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto If you're struggling with your weight, see a health professional to get advice and help.\n\nFrustratingly, it's much easier to gain weight than it is to lose weight.\n\n\"Often what we find, though, is that we can gain weight very quickly, while it takes much longer to lose it,\" O'Hanlon said. \"Think about when you go on holidays. You may come back after a month or so away having gained five kilos, yet to lose that weight it might take quite a few months.\"\n\n\"When you consume extra food it can be extremely difficult to burn off,\" Georgeou said.\n\n\"For example, it would take a women in her thirties who is between 65-70 kilos 25 minutes of swimming laps to burn off a Mars Bar. A glass of wine would take approximately 40 minutes of brisk walking for your body to burn off and two chocolate biscuits at 80 calories each would take almost 20 minutes of jogging.\"\n\nIn saying all this (frankly horrifying) information, unless someone is overweight, obese or underweight, O'Hanlon says our weight is simply a number and shouldn't be focused on too much.\n\nOur weight is just a number and it doesn't define who we are.\n\n\"The way our bodies are wired is extremely complex and there are so many different factors that affect our weight,\" O'Hanlon said.\n\n\"Rather than just focusing on our weight, we should be focusing on the bigger picture -- on our general health and wellbeing. Our weight is just a number and it doesn't define who we are.\"\n\nVisit HuffPost Australia's profile on Pinterest."

Be it sales, getting the girl or even clearing an interview.\n\nBeing deeply interested in human psychology and a hustler by nature and after hearing numerous complaints by my guy friends about not getting enough matches on online dating app Tinder, I wondered if I could \"hack\" Tinder to try and get more matches, both in quality and quantity.\n\nI could not help but wonder at the analogy between hundreds of companies hounding consumers online and guys desperate to catch a girl's attention virtually!\n\nBelieve it or not, online dating today is a $2 billion industry (in the US alone), and according to Match.com one in five relationships these days began online. It has come a long way from being a \"weird\" way of meeting people.\n\nI defined my first win as getting the girl to spend at least 3\u20134 seconds more on my pic than she would otherwise.\n\nThis hack got me 100 plus matches in less than nine days, more Tinder dates than most people will ever go on, where I met up and befriended a model, an entrepreneur, a fashion designer, a psychiatrist, a doctor, an Australian dancer, a lawyer among others.\n\nAs those familiar with it know, Tinder makes it extremely easy for girls to reject you before you can say \"Tinder\" unless you are Ranbir Kapoor himself which I'm pretty sure you're not. And if you are, in which case \"Hey Ranbir! Big fan.\"\n\nIt's scary how much choice today's internet consumer has. He/she can reject you in the blink of an eye before you even have a chance to explain your many merits.\n\nYou might be the smartest, sweetest guy around but if the girl has swiped left on you in under half a second, then your love story has ended before it's even begun.\n\nThis is exactly the problem with internet companies today who have a killer product but can't even convince a customer to try them out.\n\nTHE HACK\n\n\"Know thyself\" said the great Socrates many hundreds of years ago and it rings true to this day.\n\nA picture of me upfront on my Tinder profile would mathematically give me a 50:50 chance that a girl would either swipe left or right. But realistically speaking, an average male hardly generates 1\u20132 matches a day. Data suggests that right swipes are even rarer at <2% for the average Indian male.\n\nTinder is, at its most basic level, a game where the cards are stacked in favour of spectacularly good-looking, photogenic men.\n\nSince I was odds-on to lose in this particular game, I knew I had to manipulate this game to bring the odds in my favour.\n\nStep 1\n\nIn an app where the girl can swipe your face to obscurity in nano-seconds, I defined my first win as getting the girl to spend at least 3\u20134 seconds more on my pic than she would otherwise.\n\nThis mimics one of the central concepts of marketing and sales: The funnel\u2014 through which companies are supposed to systematically move prospects from awareness through consideration to purchase.\n\nSo how did I do that?\n\nSeth Godin puts it succinctly when he says:\n\n\"Figure what the always is. Then do something else.\"\n\nI could have done what this guy did (picture below) but then I'm no good at Photoshop. What I'm good with is words and deep thinking. And Boyzone let us all know way back, how words were all you ever needed, to take someone's heart away.\n\n\n\n\n\nDamn, Daniel!\n\nAnd so, I did this.\n\nPicture 1\n\nInstead of a picture upfront, I posted a quirky note and tried to keep it conversational and genuine.\n\nA note in between all those photos instantly gathers attention and piques curiosity! I knew that anyone who stopped to read this would swipe to the next picture for sure!\n\nAren't all dating websites just that at the end of the day: texting based on our judgment of other people's pics? Therein comes the a-ha moment for the prospect.\n\nThen I tell you that I have a slightly different idea on how to go about things.\n\nCurious? Then I hit you with a call to action which leaves the prospect in no doubt whatsoever what she is expected to do next.\n\nStep 2\n\n\n\nPicture 2\n\nThis was my second pic.\n\nI searched online for what women generally look for and sought to reassure them beforehand that I was all that they were looking for and more. Smart, intelligent and sweet are supposedly the characteristics women most look for in men. Well-educated (MBA) and well-settled (equals well-paying job) are signs of success. And behind every successful man, there are hundreds of women. Chasing him!\n\nI ended the second picture with another call to action as the prospect, at each stage, must know what is expected of him/her. I asked the girl to swipe right and to agree to a coffee if I looked anything like a nice person!\n\nTinder is a game where the cards are stacked in favour of spectacularly good-looking men. Since I was odds-on to lose... I knew I had to manipulate this game...\n\nAnd unless you have a face like Osama Bin Laden's, I'm pretty sure each and every one of you looks like a nice person when you're flashing that beautiful smile of yours.\n\nAlso, prospects need to be kept informed at all times regarding the \"why\" of what they are doing, and by telling them that I was relatively new in the city and presumably without friends, I gave them another reason to say yes.\n\nI was open enough to admit what I was actually looking for (which was meeting someone rather than incessant back-and-forth texting) and I was sure that anyone viewing my profile would have, at the very least, smiled at my ingenuity and that was more than enough leverage for me to ask her out for a coffee.\n\nVisual attraction is still the catalyst that drives most dates online, like in real life, and so I knew I had to end it with a picture of mine.\n\nAnd so we come to the final step.\n\nStep 3\n\nPicture 3\n\nBOOM. Now that expectations of physical beauty have been significantly lowered, any average looking Joe should realistically hit the bull's eye.\n\nThe quantity of my matches went up like crazy and much more importantly, so did the quality. I was extremely fortunate to meet with a lot of genuinely interesting people with whom I could never have ever got in touch with otherwise. Plus, a vast majority of these women initiated the conversations themselves which, as we men all know, NEVER happens. Some even said that this was the first time that they felt they couldn't actually resist texting a guy!\n\nTIPS\n\nPhoto\n\nI would suggest not uploading group pics on Tinder because nobody enjoys a good mystery guessing which person you are! Brightly lit pics with you smiling genuinely into the camera should do very well indeed.\n\nBio\n\nThis is extremely important as your bio is the only way to know a little bit about the person you really are. Since I'm a very casual and fun-loving guy, I tried being funny in my bio as well, as a reflection of my personality.\n\nEvidently, it worked well. Girls texted saying they couldn't stop laughing after reading my bio and seeing my pics. This gives you the upper hand pretty early, and you don't have to jump through hoops to impress the girl later, which is what usually happens.\n\nRemember, if you're not funny or don't keep her engaged, the next guy is only a few seconds away.\n\nThe girl is on Tinder to meet new guys, she's swiped right on you and has initiated a conversation. From there on, unless you completely mess it up, you're winning!\n\n\n\n\n\nBio alternative 1\n\nBio alternative 2\n\nI usually open with something funny like:\n\n\u2014 You don't know how many times I've had to swipe left to find you.\n\nRemember, if you're not funny or don't keep her engaged, the next guy is only a few seconds away.\n\nThe trick with Tinder is to move the conversation out of Tinder as soon as possible. Once again, I tried to be funny while asking for her number:\n\n\u2014 On a scale of 0 to 9999999999, what's your number?\n\nFrom there on, I guess it's pretty straightforward to fix up a date and go meet the girl. Best of luck!\n\nWarning: The best Tinder hack still remains spectacularly good looks!\n\n***\n\nSo this was basically how I changed the game in my favour by turning around the conversation in the prospect's head from:\n\n\"An above-average-looking, normal guy,\" (*swipes left in a flash*)\n\nto\n\n\"Ooh, here's something different. A smart, successful guy with a cute face. And funny. Yes, definitely funny. Coffee? Hell, I'd marry him!\"\n\nWhat I learned can be a valuable lesson for marketers looking to attract and acquire new customers , on new platforms. Sometimes, it's all about getting into the head of your prospect and turning that mental conversation around.\n\nIn a crowded marketplace, fitting in is a failure. In a busy marketplace, not standing out is the same as being invisible.\n\nGoing ahead, as average companies making average products for average people start to proliferate, those which will stand out, be bold and dare to be different, will be the ones who'll get matched most often to their customers and derive the most success.\n\nThere's too much of average out there. Beremarkable, which in essence means: something people can pass a remark on!\n\nRemarkable as in generous, daring, creative, silly and vulnerable.\n\nIn a crowded marketplace, fitting in is a failure. In a busy marketplace, not standing out is the same as being invisible.\n\nIf you loved this article and want to go for a coffee with me, or want to discuss anything ranging from product, tech, marketing, startups or Manchester United, you can tweet to me @AbhishekMadhavn"

Based on the life of Martyn Hett, one of the 22 victims of last year\u2019s terror attack, \u2018#BeMoreMartyn\u2019 is riotous, fun-filled trip down memory lane, as eight actors - playing Martyn\u2019s real friends - recall his most fabulous moments. The play takes its name from the hashtag that trended for days, as his friends and loved ones called for people to \u201cbe more Martyn\u201d in the wake of his death. The play, producer Adam Zane explains, will give people a sense of what the hashtag means.\n\nFacebook Martyn Hett\n\n\u201cWe want the audience to leave inspired by Martyn and feel empowered because he didn\u2019t just like things, he loved things,\u201d he tells HuffPost UK. \u201cAnd he was proud of the things he loved.\u201d He was famed for it too, as Martyn\u2019s love of \u2018Coronation Street\u2019 and his leg tattoo of character Deidre Barlow helped earned him an army of online followers.

There was a problem processing your signup; please try again later Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nInstagram CLOSE His passion is something Adam feels very inspired by, explaining: \u201cWhen I was a kid I hid what music I liked because I was scared to admit I liked Kylie, because I was trying to fit in. \u201cI\u2019m in my 40s and there are still moments when perhaps, I don\u2019t necessarily tell people that I\u2019m gay\u2026I might just not bring it up and why? Why am I doing that? Why not be more Martyn and just be myself? It\u2019s about how he continues to inspire people.\u201d The script of \u2018#BeMoreMartyn: The Boy With The Deidre Tattoo\u2019 - to give the production its full, glorious title - was created from interviews with Martyn\u2019s friends, a verbatim approach that the theatre company specialises in. They each sat down, one-by-one, to talk about their friend and an early version of the play was performed at a memorial event last October. Following its success - including praise from Martyn\u2019s pals who\u2019ve since found themselves as characters - the friends agreed to be interviewed again. Rewrites and rehearsals then commenced, and as Adam attempted to turn over 20 hours of interviews into a two-hour play, it was announced that the new version would debut to mark the anniversary of the attack. I arrive at their rehearsal space on one afternoon, the week before opening night. The company are practicing a scene that takes place on Canal Street, a bar-lined road which runs through the centre of Manchester\u2019s gay district, and it doesn\u2019t take long to get a sense of what Martyn was like. \u201cHe just loved bringing everyone together,\u201d says one character, describing the random selection of people who were on this particular night out. \u201cWhatever stage there was, of course, he\u2019d be on it,\u201d laughs another. \u201cThis is how he lived his life,\u201d a third character says, gesturing at the others doing shots and dancing. \u201cAnd how he taught everyone else to.\u201d\n\nHope Theatre Company The cast\n\nIt\u2019s laugh out loud funny, with scenes about dogging hotspots and run-ins with law enforcement (not at the same time) and it truly says it all that without being on stage, Martyn is still the star of the show. \u201cWhat you get from the play is a real sense of a man who lived every single second of his life,\u201d explains Bridget Gallagher, who plays Hannah. \u201cHe\u2019s a very exuberant character who was friends with so many different people. \u201cWe would utilise a lot of the stuff that went on, crazy little events like holidays to Blackpool that sounded hilarious. When he took characters from \u2018Coronation Street\u2019 and things in the media, and made them really funny. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to tell people: This guy had a really funny outlook in life.\u201d What the play doesn\u2019t do, is concentrate on the attack itself. While a number of the friends discussed what happened in their interviews (some were also at the Ariana Grande concert with Martyn), Adam \u201cmade a very clear decision that [those stories] wasn\u2019t going on stage\u201d. \u201cThose are their personal stories,\u201d he says. \u201cWe never talk about what happened in the arena, we talk about Martyn\u2019s life, not his death. That\u2019s how we keep his legacy going on.\u201d That\u2019s not to say \u2018#BeMoreMartyn\u2019 isn\u2019t without its emotional moments. During one scene, a character recalls the last time he saw Martyn, stating that he feels glad they had danced and laughed at a party. It\u2019s a sudden bittersweet line, nestled in a script that spends most of its time focused on inspiring raucous laughter. \u201cThere are moments that are really moving and sad,\u201d Adam admits. \u201cBut whenever we have a scene that is sad, we always make sure that we uplift the audience straight away, and we\u2019ll have a mad scene about Eurovision. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have those moments to reflect and allow the friends to say on stage, \u2018I miss Martyn\u2019. But also, we also want this celebration to continue and I think we\u2019ve struck the right balance. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have those moments where you go, \u2018He\u2019s not here anymore\u2019, and we\u2019re remembering him, but that doesn\u2019t mean the audience have to leave a crying wreck.\u201d\n\nHope Theatre Company"

This breach was uncovered by Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) on Thursday. HIBP is a highly trusted platform started by a Microsoft employee Troy Hunt, that lets you submit your email ID and alerts you if it shows up in any hacked databases.\n\nIt was first reported by breached database directory Vigilante.pw, and if you have an account with the site, it's a good idea to change your password. And if you re-use that password for other accounts, please stop doing that because it is not 1990 anymore.\n\nHIBP tweeted that the breach occurred in 2013, but this doesn't seem to have been reported by Yatra to users at any point. HIBP pointed out that the breach exposed email and physical addresses, apart from phone numbers, PIN codes, dates of birth, and passwords stored as plaintext.\n\nTypically, a password is stored in an encrypted manner, so that even if a database is breached, the hacker won't have immediate access to the passwords but in the case of the Yatra breach, your email ID and password combination were easily available. If you happen to use the same email and password combination on multiple websites, then it's safe to assume that those accounts have been compromised as well. In case you fall into that category, please start changing all your passwords, and better still, install a password manager.\n\nAlthough there have been cases of data breaches in India, few companies have come forward and publicly addressed this. Last year, Zomato was hacked and 17 million user accounts compromised, although Zomato later said that the hacker had agreed to stop selling the user data, making a deal with the company instead. Soon after this, Zomato launched one of the few serious bug bounty programs in India, where companies pay researchers for exposing flaws in their security. This is a standard practice around the world, and helps to identify and remove weaknesses from systems, but in India most companies don't follow this practice.\n\nSecurity researchers talked of big payouts from companies like Facebook and Uber, while being ignored at home. Even the few companies that do offer money, including Zomato, Ola, and Paytm, rarely acknowledged weaknesses, and security researchers said this hurts their credibility."

While Harry has captured the world\u2019s attention for decades, Meghan has piqued many people\u2019s interests in the last few years, first for her acting role on \u201cSuits\u201d and her humanitarian work, and now as she prepares to join the British royal family.\n\nWe wanted to know what exactly the internet was wondering about Meghan. So we mimicked a Google search about the former actress to learn what people were searching in real time and turned to Google Trends to see popular searches over the last year and in the last 30 days. Here are some of the most common questions, keywords and searches associated with Meghan on Google.\n\n\u2018Meghan Markle father\u2019\n\nIn a 2015 essay for Elle, Meghan shared that her dad, Thomas Markle, and her mom, Doria Ragland, met in the late 1970s. Doria was a temp at the studio where Thomas was working as a lighting director for a soap opera. Thomas also worked on the sitcom \u201cMarried With Children,\u201d which Meghan brought up in an interview with Esquire in 2013.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to watch it at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI could watch the end credits so I could give the screen a kiss when I saw my dad\u2019s name go by.\u201d\n\nThe recent surge in searches for Meghan\u2019s dad likely has to do with his probable absence the day of the wedding. On May 4, Kensington Palace confirmed that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. In the weeks prior to the wedding, her dad was photographed preparing for the event by reading books about Britain, exercising and being fitted for a suit.\n\nReports emerged this week that he had staged the photos, and Thomas told TMZ he was responsible. He also said he recently had a heart attack and that he would not be attending the wedding. On Tuesday, Thomas seemed to change his mind, telling TMZ he would be attending, then he changed his story again, saying he had a major heart surgery scheduled and would not be traveling to Britain for the event.\n\nKensington Palace has since put out a statement from Meghan confirming that her father will not attend the wedding.\n\n\u201cI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health,\u201d she wrote in the statement. She also thanked \u201ceveryone who has offered generous messages of support.\u201d Many wondered if Meghan\u2019s mom would walk her down the aisle, but Kensington Palace tweeted Friday that Prince Charles will accompany her. \u2018Meghan Markle mother\u2019\n\nUnlike Meghan\u2019s father, her mom has met Prince Harry. The royal and his future mother-in-law were both in attendance at the 2017 Invictus Games closing ceremony. During Meghan and Harry\u2019s first joint interview after their engagement, Harry described Ragland as \u201camazing.\u201d"

Luther [Lebelo, human resource manager at Sars] is going to tell them you are not well,\" Moyane continues.\n\n\"Ja, you are not well.\"\n\nA brief conversation follows, in which Moyane instructs Lombard not to come to work, and to stay home and calm down. He also tells Lombard he is \"behind\" him.\n\nMoyane also thanks Lombard for revealing information to him the previous day \u2014 but it is not clear what Lombard told Moyane.\n\n\"Just say: 'I am not well'... if they do call you from KPMG, say: 'I am not well,'\" Moyane says, shortly before the call ends.\n\nListen to the unedited call between Moyane and Lombard here:\n\nLombard was scheduled to meet with KPMG later that same day \u2014 May 7 2015 \u2014 but never did. It was not immediately clear what Lombard was expected to reveal to the firm.\n\nKPMG was appointed by Moyane to investigate allegations of a \"rogue\" unit within Sars, that allegedly conducted covert intelligence gathering operations unlawfully \u2014 including allegedly bugging Jacob Zuma's Forest Town home.\n\nThe allegations have largely been disproved, and KPMG has since withdrawn the findings and recommendations in the report \u2014 and furthermore paid back the R23-million it was paid to compile it.\n\nLongstanding allegations of interference in the KPMG report have come in the form of a memo drafted by attorneys representing Sars, suggesting that certain findings and recommendations be added to the report.\n\nThese found their way into the report verbatim.\n\nIn support of the recording, News24 has obtained a supplementary affidavit dated March 21 2018 filed by Lombard in an unrelated matter \u2014 the \"Project Sunday Evenings\" case that was before court on Monday.\n\nThat case deals with three former Sars officials accused of illegally bugging the National Prosecuting Authority's head office in 2007.\n\nIn his affidavit, Lombard states he informed Moyane on May 6 that he had to avail himself to KPMG for an interview the following day. He called Moyane the next morning as requested by the commissioner.\n\n\"It was in this conversation that Mr Moyane instructed me not to avail myself for the said interview and to pretend that I was ill. I obeyed the said instruction,\" Lombard's affidavit reads.\n\n\"I never testified before the KPMG commission [sic]. I want to emphasise the fact that I was not ill and was able to testify if necessary.\"\n\nLombard goes a step further and states the recording was in his possession under lock and key at all times and attached a transcript thereof.\n\nThe existence of the transcript was first reported by Daily Maverick.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa suspended Moyane earlier this year, and he is determined to drag Moyaneto a disciplinary inquiry to ventilate the accusations against the suspended commissioner.\n\nGordhan's affidavit in support of the charges, filed with advocate Azhar Bham, who is heading the disciplinary inquiry, claims the instructions by Moyane to Lombard constituted an abuse of the office of the Sars commissioner.\n\n\"By instructing Mr Lombard not to attend the interview, Mr Moyane ensured that information relevant to the investigation was withheld,\" Gordhan states.\n\nThe Times via Getty Images\n\nMoyane's actions also violated the Sars code of conduct, Gordhan argues.\n\nThe suspended commissioner is further charged with grossly mishandling an FIC report on his second-in-charge at Sars, Jonas Makwakwa, unauthorised bonus payments to Sars managers, and misleading Parliament.\n\nMoyane's attorney, Eric Mabuza, told News24 on Thursday morning that Moyane is on record denying all charges against him without fail, \"...including any recordings generated by the rogue unit and its founders who currently serve in government,\" Mabuza said, in an apparent reference to Gordhan.\n\n\"His denial covers all the allegations which have been written by Minister Gordhan last week and predictably leaked to embedded journalists even before his lawyers were served with the minister's affidavit. It also covers this latest alleged recording which seemingly contains the big 'revelation' that an employee had earlier reported himself to be sick to his boss and was having some kind of a follow-up conversation.\"\n\n\"If this is the kind of nonsense for which the commissioner was suspended, thereby threatening the entire economy of South Africa, all we can say is our own country needs serious prayer,\" Mabuza alleged.\n\nLombard meanwhile claimed he was prohibited from speaking to the media, as matters were before the courts.\n\nNews24"

He could have used any other song.\"\n\nThe family has been so unnerved by this situation that they've withheld the news from the legendary singer herself.\n\nThe family member further stated, \"Why did Karan Johar use Lata Didi's immortal song in such an embarrassing situation? I still remember how ecstatic Karan was when Didi had recorded the song for Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. He said it was a dream come true.

Et puis c\u2019est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire \u00bb, r\u00e9sume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d\u2019environ 2600 \u00e2mes dans la r\u00e9gion de Portneuf, et dont la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9conomie tourne autour de l\u2019agriculture.\n\n\n\nPeu avant No\u00ebl dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d\u2019origine fran\u00e7aise, mettait fin \u00e0 ses jours en se pendant dans l\u2019atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducr\u00eat, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 un jet de pierre de la mairie.\n\n\n\nPour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur \u00e9tait une \u00e9toile filante dans le firmament des fromagers qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. \u00ab C\u2019\u00e9tait quelqu\u2019un d\u2019assez r\u00e9serv\u00e9. Mais d\u00e8s que vous parliez d\u2019agriculture, vous constatiez combien il \u00e9tait passionn\u00e9! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, \u00e9taient exceptionnels, irrempla\u00e7ables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui \u00bb, raconte Charles Trottier, copropri\u00e9taire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la m\u00eame profession, l\u2019a bien connu.\n\n\n\nLes deux fromagers artisans ont pass\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la crise de la list\u00e9riose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et o\u00f9 le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture, des P\u00eacheries et de l\u2019Alimentation (MAPAQ) exon\u00e9rait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bact\u00e9rie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bact\u00e9rie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteuris\u00e9. Mais le mal \u00e9tait fait, le Qu\u00e9bec ne compte plus aujourd\u2019hui, avec le d\u00e9part de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand C\u00f4t\u00e9, pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Association des fromagers artisans du Qu\u00e9bec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.\n\n\n\nPour op\u00e9rer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 \u00e0 17 permis diff\u00e9rents.\n\n\u2013 Charles Trottier\n\n\n\nUn m\u00e9tier sous tr\u00e8s haute tension\n\n\n\nLe m\u00e9tier de fromager-artisan rel\u00e8ve des 12 travaux d\u2019Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par ann\u00e9e, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l\u2019eau d\u2019un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygi\u00e9niques aussi salubres qu\u2019une salle d\u2019op\u00e9ration d\u2019h\u00f4pital. Et il faut l\u2019emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es ou les restaurants.\n\n\n\n\u00ab C\u2019est trois m\u00e9tiers dans un \u00bb, explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu\u2019il faut composer avec le stress de la m\u00e9t\u00e9o, la ferme \u00e9tant une usine \u00e0 ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d\u2019alimenter les vaches.\n\n\n\nC'est dans l'\u00e9tabli de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin \u00e0 ses jours.\n\n\n\nDe plus, ce m\u00e9tier s\u2019exerce sous une charge administrative kafka\u00efenne. \u00ab Pour op\u00e9rer notre fromagerie, j\u2019ai besoin de 16 \u00e0 17 permis diff\u00e9rents, dont un de fabrication du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture, un permis du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au d\u00e9tail, de l\u2019organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalit\u00e9\u2026 \u00bb poursuit Charles Trottier.\n\n\n\nComme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la d\u00e9cision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l\u2019importation de 16 000 tonnes m\u00e9triques de fromages fins en provenance d\u2019Europe d\u00e8s le 21 septembre prochain sous l\u2019Accord \u00e9conomique et commercial entre le Canada et l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. \u00ab Cette importation, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de 640 fermes comme la n\u00f4tre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affect\u00e9s \u00bb, croit Charles Trottier.\n\n\n\nDepuis ses d\u00e9buts, l\u2019homme d\u2019affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle \u00e9table. Et il compte sur sa client\u00e8le qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque ann\u00e9e -- pour survivre.\n\n\n\nContrairement \u00e0 Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 \u00e0 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associ\u00e9 et une vingtaine d\u2019employ\u00e9s, \u00ab Rudy, lui, op\u00e9rait seul, avec l\u2019\u00e9nergie de la jeunesse \u00bb.\n\n\n\nC\u2019est peut-\u00eatre parce qu\u2019il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnomm\u00e9 son produit vedette \u00ab Le Gaulois de Portneuf \u00bb, gagnant d\u2019un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.\n\n\n\nCharles Trottier, co-propri\u00e9taire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.\n\n\n\nCombien d\u2019agriculteurs se suicident?\n\n\u00ab Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est repr\u00e9sentatif de l\u2019\u00e9tat psychologique de l\u2019ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Qu\u00e9bec \u00bb, dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d\u2019intervention sur le suicide et l\u2019euthanasie (CRISE) \u00e0 l\u2019UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu\u2019une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laiti\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec, ils sont le porte-\u00e9tendard d\u2019une industrie qui g\u00e9n\u00e8re pr\u00e8s de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.\n\n\n\nSelon la doctorante, le m\u00e9tier d\u2019agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus \u00e0 risque de stress \u00e0 cause d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments incontr\u00f4lables comme la m\u00e9t\u00e9o. Mais la mondialisation, les trait\u00e9s commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l\u2019endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l\u2019isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s\u2019additionnent et font grimper le taux de la d\u00e9tresse psychologique. \u00ab Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019\u00e9lastique p\u00e8te \u00bb, explique celle qui a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Qu\u00e9bec qu\u2019en France et en Suisse1.\n\n\n\nToutefois, la seule \u00e9tude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois indiquait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait le double de celui des hommes dans la population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Mais cette \u00e9tude2 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Sant\u00e9 Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le probl\u00e8me, pour obtenir l\u2019heure juste, c\u2019est que l\u2019Institut national de la sant\u00e9 publique du Qu\u00e9bec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois se sont enlev\u00e9 la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.\n\n\n\nParmi les pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s, la France s\u2019est toutefois dot\u00e9e en 2013 d\u2019un Observatoire national du suicide qui d\u00e9nombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 \u00e0 2009, surtout dans les \u00e9levages de bovins.\n\n\n\nRudy Ducreux, l\u2019arbre qui cache la for\u00eat?\n\n\n\nNotre enqu\u00eate r\u00e9v\u00e8le cependant que le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Parlez-en \u00e0 Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L\u2019homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropri\u00e9taire avec ses fr\u00e8res de la seconde plus grosse \u00e9rabli\u00e8re de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner \u00e0 la ferme Ducr\u00eat.\n\nLa vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.\n\n\u2013 Laurier Gauthier\n\nEn chemin, \u00e0 bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d\u2019un de ses voisins. \u00ab Lui aussi il s\u2019est suicid\u00e9. Puis pourtant, il avait de l\u2019argent plein les poches. Il venait de s\u2019acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait tir\u00e9 un coup de 22 en arri\u00e8re des oreilles. Surprise totale \u00bb. Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employ\u00e9 de ferme, qui se sont enlev\u00e9 la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilom\u00e8tres de son entreprise.\n\n\n\nQuant au geste irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l\u2019explique peut-\u00eatre par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, \u00ab la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec \u00bb, dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, le producteur pointe du doigt l\u2019actuel contexte socio-\u00e9conomique comme facteur important de d\u00e9tresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, depuis le r\u00e8gne du ministre de l\u2019Agriculture p\u00e9quiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souverainet\u00e9 alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l\u2019Agriculture \u00e0 temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.\n\n\n\nQuant au f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le producteur se demande jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 Ottawa, dans l\u2019actuelle ren\u00e9gociation de l\u2019ALENA exig\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident Donald Trump, est pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre la gestion de l\u2019offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d\u2019\u0153uvre, de l\u2019automobile ou de l\u2019aviation.\n\n\n\nNous arrivons \u00e0 la ferme Ducr\u00eat. Rudy Ducreux avait achet\u00e9 en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et fr\u00e8re du psychiatre controvers\u00e9 Pierre \u00ab Doc \u00bb Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. Elle h\u00e9site \u00e0 parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l\u2019avocat engag\u00e9 par la succession \u00ab pour ne pas nuire \u00e0 la vente de la ferme \u00bb, pr\u00e9vue d\u2019ici l\u2019automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 rapatri\u00e9 par la famille.\n\n\n\nConnie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.\n\n\n\nLa jeune femme explique avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 recrut\u00e9e pour traire le troupeau de 26 b\u00eates. \u00c0 part le cliquetis des cha\u00eenes des vaches \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9table, le silence r\u00e8gne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l\u2019\u00e9tabli et des remises d\u00e9sert\u00e9s. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d\u2019un b\u00e2timent \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\n\n\n\nDans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d\u2019arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultiv\u00e9es. Comme l\u2019arbre qui cache la for\u00eat, le suicide du cr\u00e9ateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l\u2019agriculture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise en p\u00e9ril.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n1 Droz, Y., Mi\u00e9ville-Ott, V., Jacques-Jouvenot, D. et Lafleur, G.

The former actress arrived at Windsor Castle in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom IV on Saturday. As soon as she stepped out of the car, Markle gave fans a glimpse of her gorgeous wedding gown, designed by Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy. Waight Keller, who is British, became the first female artistic director at Givenchy last year. The stunning, modern silk dress has three-quarter-length sleeves, an open bateau neckline and a train cushioned by triple silk organza, according to Kensington Palace. Markle also wore white gold and diamond Galanterie de Cartier earrings and a Reflection de Cartier bracelet, both from Cartier.\n\nPress Association\n\nMarkle wore her hair up with a veil and Queen Mary\u2019s diamond bandeau tiara, according to Kensington Palace. \u201cThe diamond bandeau is English and was made in 1932, with the entre brooch dating from 1893,\u201d the palace said.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images\n\nOLI SCARFF via Getty Images\n\nOWEN HUMPHREYS via Getty Images\n\nBEN STANSALL via Getty Images\n\nKensington Palace released details about the dress on Saturday, shortly after Markle\u2019s arrival. \u201cAfter meeting Ms. Waight Keller in early 2018, Ms. Markle chose to work with her for her timeless and elegant aesthetic, impeccable tailoring, and relaxed demeanour,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMs. Markle and Ms. Waight Keller worked closely together on the design. The dress epitomises a timeless minimal elegance referencing the codes of the iconic House of Givenchy and showcasing the expert craftsmanship of its world-renowned Parisian couture atelier founded in 1952.\u201d The gorgeous veil includes a nod to all 53 countries of the Commonwealth, as Waight Keler added in the \u201cdistinctive flora\u201d of each country, according to Kensington Palace.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images\n\nPA Wire/PA Images\n\nMike Egerton - PA Images via Getty Images\n\nPrince Harry and his brother, Prince William, wore military dress for the occasion.\n\nODD ANDERSEN via Getty Images\n\nPrior to the big day, fans couldn\u2019t stop speculating about which designer Markle would choose for her wedding dress. For her official engagement photos with Prince Harry, the former actress wore a sheer gown from the British design house Ralph & Russo that reportedly cost a whopping $75,000.\n\nA post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST\n\nMany thought she would choose Ralph & Russo again, or go with designers Erdem, Jenny Packham, Christopher Bailey, Stella McCartney or Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, like the Duchess of Cambridge did for her 2011 nuptials. Markle\u2019s mom sparked speculation that her daughter might go with Burberry, as Ragland was spotted heading to LAX with a garment bag from the designer in hand on Tuesday. The bride chose Stella McCartney for her second, more relaxed dress. She changed just before the couple took off in a Jaguar E-Type for their private reception with 200 friends and family members.

That\u2019s the consensus that emerged among journalists, Democrats on Capitol Hill, critics of the administration, nuclear nonproliferation experts and foreign policy wonks mere hours after President Donald Trump wrapped up his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump gave up too much and got too little, the argument goes, and accomplished little more than a vague reformulation of past promises.\n\nBut the critics of Trump\u2019s outreach to North Korea ignore a key fact: Less than a year ago, Trump and Kim were trading personal insults and threatening to take their countries to war. It\u2019s too soon to tell whether Trump\u2019s concessions to Kim were worth the risk \u2014 but given the administration\u2019s past stance, it\u2019s worth holding off on declaring the gambit a failure.\n\n\u201cWhat would you rather have? Confrontation or the possibility of a peaceful path forward?\u201d said Joel Wit, a former State Department official who helped negotiate the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea. \u201cThe problem is most people seem to have forgotten what it was like seven or eight months ago, with all the tests, the fear of nuclear war.\u201d\n\nTrump had given North Korea watchers plenty of reason for skepticism. It was his tweets, after all, that had America wondering last year if the country was on the brink of nuclear war. When Trump decided he was interested in talking to Kim, he didn\u2019t seem concerned with diving into the details of nuclear nonproliferation policy. His administration backed away from nominating Victor Cha, a well-respected Korea expert, as the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, after learning that Cha opposed preventive military action in North Korea. Trump later appointed as national security adviser John Bolton, who has repeatedly called for bombing North Korea. And weeks before the meeting with Kim, Trump briefly backed out of the summit entirely.\n\nThe outcomes of Tuesday\u2019s summit were also imperfect. After receiving a superstar\u2019s welcome in Singapore, Kim agreed to destroy a missile engine testing site. Pyongyang said it had already halted its nuclear and ballistic missile tests and possibly destroyed one of its nuclear weapon test sites. All of North Korea\u2019s moves are either easily reversible or hard to enforce.\n\nIn return, Trump handed Kim a publicity win and promised to halt joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. Both concessions, Trump\u2019s detractors argue, were too big."

The sequel, which arrived 14 years after the original film, brought an even more grown-up version of the franchise\u2019s signature parent-centric humor. But the character who does the most growing out of anyone in the movie is baby Jack-Jack \u2015 courtesy of some classical jams. Yes, in \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d it appears listening to Mozart helps bring out Jack-Jack\u2019s new superhero forms, some of which are fire baby, floating baby and monster baby. To the internet\u2019s delight, the joke is clearly based on the idea that classical music, specifically Mozart, might aid in cognitive development. Sadly, if you\u2019re a parent who thinks their kid could also get a superpowered boost from listening to classical tunes, we have some bad news. First off, we\u2019re worried about you. Secondly, the experts we talked to pooh-poohed the notion that listening to Mozart and his classical compatriots would have any positive effects on development, let alone spark superpowers.\n\nPixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney Pictures Jack-Jack and Bob in \"Incredibles 2.\"\n\nProfessor Christopher Chabris, a cognitive psychologist at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania and co-author of The Invisible Gorilla: How Our Intuitions Deceive Us, said the perception that Mozart has an effect on development and intelligence is misinformed. \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise you to hear that there is no scientific evidence that listening to Mozart can bring out super powers in a baby, or anyone else,\u201d he said in an email. Bummer. \u201cIn the 1990s, many music companies put out CDs and videos based on exactly this idea, e.g. \u2018Mozart Makes You Smarter,\u2019 \u2018Baby Mozart,\u2019 which led to \u2018Baby Einstein\u2019 and related products,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, the truth is that after many studies, there is no reason to believe that listening to Mozart\u2019s music will make anyone smarter: not adults, not children, not babies, not fetuses. This has been known since 1999, when I published an article in Nature showing that the so-called \u2018Mozart Effect\u2019 was a fluke, not a reproducible scientific effect.\u201d Jakob Pietschnig, a psychologist at the University of Vienna who\u2019s also done studies on the \u201cMozart Effect,\u201d agreed with Chabris. \u201cThe evidence for a performance-enhancing effect of music exposure is depressingly little (i.e., virtually zero),\u201d he told us. Though Pietschnig wasn\u2019t impressed with Mozart\u2019s results on increasing intelligence, he did say music training is more promising. \u201cIt is pretty clear that mere exposure to Mozart/classical music does not do anything to enhance intelligence. However, there are some accounts that suggest that music training may be linked to cognitive abilities to a certain extent. I would not go as far to call this solid evidence though, especially because the causality has not been clearly established.\u201d\n\nDisney Jack-Jack shows Dad his monster mode in \"Incredibles 2.\"\n\nThough Jack-Jack\u2019s powers are featured in \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d we first got a glimpse of the baby\u2019s super-potential at the end of the original movie, when his multiple abilities allowed him to escape the grip of the villain Syndrome. But the first time Jack-Jack\u2019s powers appear occurred in the short \u201cJack-Jack Attack,\u201d which is on the \u201cIncredibles\u201d DVD and covers events that happen chronologically before the baby is captured by Syndrome. Jack-Jack\u2019s abilities manifest around the time his babysitter plays him some classical music, leading fans to speculate that Mozart was the impetus for his powers. \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d basically confirms that theory. After Edna Mode creates a super suit to help control Jack-Jack\u2019s abilities and shows it off to his dad, Bob Parr, we learn that, indeed, Mozart is somehow able to bring out Jack-Jack\u2019s powers. Unfortunately, try as we might, we couldn\u2019t get an expert to entertain the idea that this might be plausible in real life. Mozart won\u2019t awaken your baby\u2019s superpowers, let alone make him or her smarter. That only happens to Jack-Jack. Which maybe isn\u2019t such a bad thing."

Could you maybe not, body? Seriously, is that extra slice of banana bread really to blame?\n\nDon't worry, everyone. There are a few reasonable explanations as to why the scales said you gained weight all of a sudden. PHEW.\n\n\"I personally don't recommend my clients weigh themselves daily and, in fact, I ask them to limit it to weekly or even fortnightly -- if at all,\" nutritionist Pip Reed told The Huffington Post Australia.\n\nSelf-worth should not be determined by, or dependent on, a number on a scale.\n\n\"Daily weigh-ins can create unnecessary stress, fixation, pressure and even obsession which is not healthy for anyone.\"\n\nDietitian Robbie Clark agrees, saying constantly weighing yourself is a bad representation of your true weight, and can warp your sense of self-worth.\n\n\"I do not recommend my clients do this. By seeing daily fluctuations of increases and losses, it creates an overwhelming fixation and burden,\" Clark told HuffPost Australia.\n\nPeter Dazeley Your weight doesn't define who you are.\n\n\"For some, when they become fixated on the scale number, it becomes a marker of their self-worth. If the scale shows a 'good' (lower) number, they feel better about themselves. However, if the scale shows a 'bad' (higher) number, they may feel like they have failed.\n\n\"Their entire mood becomes dependent on a number and an entire day can result in complete negativity and despair if they are not happy with what they see on the scales.\"\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that constantly weighing yourself can lead to unhealthy, obsessive eating and exercise habits.\n\n\"Fixating on weight can be detrimental to your emotional wellbeing as you cause yourself unnecessary stress, obsessing about any slight fluctuation that may not be related to how much you are eating and exercising at all,\" Reed said.\n\n\"Scales can create an artificial sense of confidence for some, and they can also crush it, especially if you have set specific weight loss goals,\" Clark added. \"People may start judging food or fitness choices against a number on the scale, which is extremely unhealthy.\"\n\nGetty\n\n\"Weighing yourself does not take into account muscle mass and growth, fluid retention, hormones and period cycles for females, and may instead cause someone on a weight loss journey to give up as they are not seeing results on a daily basis,\" Reed said.\n\n\"Not only does your weight change every day, it also changes at different times throughout a single day. So there is no point weighing yourself every day -- and definitely not multiple times a day,\" Clark said.\n\nHere are six reasonable explanations as to why the scales said you gained (or lost) weight all of a sudden.\n\n1. You have gained muscle mass\n\nIf you've been training hard and get on the scales and see you've gained a few kilos (but still feel the same weight, or slimmer), chances are you've gained muscle mass, which is much more dense than fat.\n\n\"A kilogram is a kilogram -- both a kilogram of muscle and a kilogram of fat weigh the same. However, one takes up significantly less space,\" Clark explained.\n\n\"Muscle, by design, is denser and more fibrous in nature, as it serves to help support and move your entire body. Since dense muscle tissue takes up less space than fat, it's possible you may weigh the same (or even more) yet appear slimmer than another person with the same weight, a similar height and frame because of the difference in your body composition.\"\n\nJohn Fedele If you've been training hard and eating well, see your muscle weight gain as an achievement.\n\nIn simple terms: a kilogram of muscle occupies less space than a kilogram of fat, hence the illusion of gaining weight or 'fat'.\n\n\"So while you may be losing weight, if you're working out you're inevitably putting muscle on too which is going to help fire up your metabolism, but may not give the whole picture on the scales as you find yourself either weighing the same, or sometimes weighing more, despite having lost fat mass,\" Reed said.\n\n2. You are a menstruating woman\n\nLadies, if you've ever felt heavier or bigger at certain times of the month, you're not being paranoid. A woman's weight tends to fluctuate due to changes in hormones.\n\n\"Females in particular are prone to daily weight fluctuations due to ovulation and periods, often causing fluid retention and therefore weight gain, and this constant rise and fall on the scales is not indicative of true weight,\" Reed said.\n\n\"Some women put on up to four kilograms in fluid pre-period and even at ovulation too, and in this case you should certainly seek out a healthcare practitioner who specialises in hormone balance to assist with this issue.\"\n\nGetty Images Thanks, hormones.\n\n3. You've drunk fluid or eaten food\n\nThat litre of water you just drank? Yep, that accounts for one kilogram of weight. The same goes for food which you have just eaten.\n\n\"The scales may simply fluctuate based on how much fluid you have drunk that day or even how much you have eaten,\" Reed said.\n\n4. You're wearing heavy clothes\n\nLikewise, if you weighed yourself naked two days ago, and now you're at your friend's house in your winter getup and boots, the scales will reflect this.\n\n\"And of course, wearing clothing will cause fluctuations. Weighing yourself first thing in the morning, after you have been to the bathroom and are naked, is going to give you a more accurate reading,\" Reed said.\n\n\"However, again, you should only do this every week or fortnight, so as not to become fixated and disheartened by a few hundred grams here or there of fluctuation.\n\nTommL Weigh yourself naked, at the same time, on the same day of the week, on the same scales.\n\n5. Your diet is high in sodium\n\nIf your diet is full of salty foods, this can cause water retention and thus increase the number on those scales.\n\n\"The reason these weight fluctuations occur is because of body fluid fluctuations -- your body might retain water from a high sodium consumption, or you may not have gone to the bathroom yet,\" Clark said.\n\n6. You've just had a sweaty workout session\n\n\"On the other end of the scale (pun intended), people who weigh themselves after a big gym session may see that they have lost weight,\" Clark said.\n\n\"This loss, however, is more likely to be fluid loss through sweat rather than direct fat loss.\"\n\nZoonar RF Intense exercise and sweating can make it appear as though you've lost weight.\n\nHow often should we really weigh ourselves? According to Clark and Reed, maximum once per week -- and not with the scales you think.\n\n\"If losing weight or gaining muscle mass is your goal, weighing in weekly with scales that are going to give a better indication of muscle versus fat versus fluid mass is going to be more helpful (if you have these type of scales available) than a daily weigh in,\" Reed said.\n\n\"It's important to also include measurements to get a more accurate assessment of your body changes. The best weigh in or body assessment you can do for yourself is to use a DEXA Scan (body fat analysis) once a month if you are really interested in your data, until you reach your goals.\"\n\nClark also urges everyone to implement consistency when weighing yourself so the reading is accurate.\n\n\"Once per week is enough to help you stay accountable without becoming obsessed, which should be at the same time, on the same day of the week, wearing similar clothing (or none at all), and most importantly, on the same scale,\" Clark said.\n\n\"By weighing yourself once per week, you allow time for the scales to actually show weight (fat) loss.\n\npixdeluxe Instead of focusing on the number, focus on how healthy you FEEL.\n\n\"When talking about reducing body fat, the general population isn't well informed about what is considered to be a safe, healthy and sustainable loss and over what timeframe. A healthy goal is striving for 0.5 kilograms to one kilogram of fat loss per week. The ability to achieve this, however, is determined by many factors.\"\n\nAnd in saying all this, it's important not to forget: our weight is just a number and it doesn't define who we are.\n\n\"My advice to people is that self-worth should not be determined by, or dependent on, a number on a scale. They should be determining their health by other numbers and factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, insulin and inflammatory markers,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Regardless of whether you fall into this metabolically healthy category or not, these factors are far more indicative of overall health status than the numbers on the scale, and not to mention potentially lifesaving.\n\n\"When you make healthy lifestyle choices, you can see dramatic, long-lasting changes in these particular numbers, which should be motivation in itself to keep pushing on with healthy eating and exercise habits.\n\n\"Other markers for better health that people should be looking at are improved energy levels, better sleep, clearer skin, better bowel movements, better sex and feeling happier and healthier.\"\n\nIf you need help in a crisis, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Many parents might not know that there are certain features they should be looking for in their little one's new bed, or how to make the transition a tear-free one.\n\nTiming is key\n\nAround the age of three or older is the best time to begin the switch from a crib to a proper bed, Amanda Jewson, certified sleep consultant and owner of Toronto-based Baby's Best Sleep, told HuffPost Canada.\n\n\"A three-year-old can understand rewards and they like to please,\" she said. \"Helping them transition while making them feel confident is key here.\"\n\nShe says the key to making this a tear-free move is to support your child and build them up. Having them choose their own bedding is one way of doing this. Another is to make sure you have a strong bedtime/waking routine in place before making the switch.\n\nLiz Ann Photography via Getty Images\n\n\"A week before, let them know they are big enough to go into a big kid bed now. Create reward charts that reward good behaviour around bedtime \u2014 and don't forget to also include boundaries around bed,\" she said. \"Set up an alarm clock or an 'OK to wake' clock in an inaccessible part of the bedroom to help them understand when it's OK to be out of bed.\"\n\nMike Gettis echoes Jewson's advice. The co-founder and CEO of Endy is currently in the process of transitioning his own three-year-old son into a big kid bed.\n\n\"We switched our three-year-old son, John, from his crib with the side removed back to his crib with the side on after he was struggling to settle in at night,\" Gettis told HuffPost Canada. \"There's no rush \u2014 he really likes his crib, so we're easing him into the transition. When he's ready, we'll get him involved in setting up his big kid bed to get him excited about the transition.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a mattress for kids\n\nA mattress that provides deep, restorative sleep is a must for growing kids, Gettis said, and this can usually be found in a mattress that's medium-firm, comfortable, and supports the spine.\n\n\"An overly firm mattress might prove uncomfortable during growing pains, and a mattress that is too soft might wear down quickly,\" he said.\n\nallensima via Getty Images\n\nA mattress protector or waterproof cover that is removable and machine-washable for the occasional accident is key. A pillow top or mattress with a foam topper can also give kids the feeling of being \"hugged\" and make switching to a big bed easier, Gettis said.\n\nGettis notes that the materials used are another important consideration when it comes to choosing a mattress for little ones. \"The Endy Mattress is CertiPUR-US certified, which means our foam does not contain formaldehyde, phthalates, or flame retardants.\" Other popular mattresses with this distinction include Serta, Sleep Number, and Casper, among hundreds of other brands.\n\nWhat to look for in a pillow for kids\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a pillow for your kids, the most important factor is pillow height, also known as loft. Adult pillows contain more fill than kids need, which can cause neck and back pain and sleeplessness. Choosing a pillow with the correct loft for your three-year-old means it might not fit them when they're six or seven, so be prepared to periodically switch out your child's pillow.\n\nGettis also suggests parents choose a pillow that is washable and hypoallergenic.\n\nWhat to look for in a bed frame for kids\n\nWhen shopping for a frame for your kid's mattress, Jewson says it's important to look for something that is solidly built.\n\n\"It's likely that mom or dad will be snuggling in there with a book before bedtime,\" she pointed out.\n\nkate_sept2004 via Getty Images\n\nWhile there are specially-designed toddler beds that include built-in bed rails, you won't get as much use out of them as you would simply buying a single or twin bed from the get-go and adding your own bed rails.\n\nParents should also look for frames that preschoolers can easily climb up and down on their own for the inevitable nighttime bathroom trip. Jewson also points out the finish used on the frame is another important consideration to keep in mind.\n\n\"If your child puts their wet towel on a foot board, will it ruin it? They're kids after all.\"\n\nKeep in mind that while that princess/car/spaceship headboard might be cute when they're little, it probably won't be their style 10 years down the line. And don't forget to evaluate how easy it is to disassemble and reassemble the frame if you move frequently.\n\nSafety considerations with a big bed\n\nOne of the most important pieces of safety equipment when your child transitions to their own bed is a bed rail.\n\nHealth Canada notes that portable bed rails should not be used with children under the age of two, should meet the latest ASTM International standard, and should only be used with beds that have both a mattress and box spring.\n\nJewson also says that parents should reassess their child's room for safety once they are fully mobile, making sure to secure and hide all electrical and blind cords, and ensuring that all furniture is securely attached to the wall.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

It was an experience Sanchez says changed her life forever. Jojo was being kept illegally as a pet, and when Sanchez found him he was chained up by his ankle and surrounded by litter and dirty sewage water. She broke open the chain and gave him some medication. But once she was done, she had to put the chain back on and leave Jojo because there was nowhere to take him. This encounter, back in 2008, drove her to set up a center to rehabilitate orangutans. A year later, she went back to get Jojo. After years of mistreatment and poor nutrition, he was disabled and had been left unable to survive in the wild, but he would never be chained up again. Today, Sanchez\u2019s team of more than 250 people at the Indonesian branch of International Animal Rescue is on the frontline of rescuing and rehabilitating vulnerable orangutans on Borneo before releasing them \u2014 when possible \u2014 back into the wild.\n\nBBC/International Animal Rescue Baby orangutan Udin is rescued from the illegal wildlife pet trade.\n\nBBC/Alejo Sabugo/International Animal Rescue Since the explosion in the use of palm oil in 2000, Borneo has lost 20,000 square miles of forest.\n\nWhile some brands proudly advertise their use of sustainable palm oil \u2014 meaning production has to meet certain environmental and labor standards \u2014 in reality, there\u2019s no such thing, Sanchez says. \u201cSustainable? I mean, monoculture cannot be sustainable, period,\u201d says the 39-year-old, shaking her head. \u201cIf you maybe ask me about a more environmentally friendly palm oil, yes, it would be possible. Although at the moment it does not exist.\u201d The work Sanchez and her team does is messy, complicated stuff that involves bringing together companies, government authorities and communities in an effort to get primates back to their natural habitats \u2014 even if this isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s priority \u2014 and ideally prevents the need for any rescue efforts to start with. Sanchez is adamant that while this kind of cross-sector work is hard, it is vital since rehabilitation and reintroduction efforts alone are not a solution. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you are sick and you get a [painkiller] \u2014 you treat the symptoms but you don\u2019t really solve the root of the problem. You can be treating the symptoms forever, right?\u201d she says. The answer, says Sanchez, lies in the private sector\u2019s willingness to take the environment into account long before any forest destruction has occurred, to ensure orangutans\u2019 habitat is not destroyed. While some companies have realized that it\u2019s good for them to explore more sustainable ways of development, there are still so many that just don\u2019t care, she says. Then there\u2019s the problem of companies relying on International Animal Rescue to remove orangutans once they have cut down forest. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they call us [when they need help],\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cBut, on the other hand, they should have never cleared forest where there were orangutans in the first place. We want to protect the animals, we want to save the animals, but we don\u2019t want to be like a garbage cleaning service for these companies, you know: \u2018I clear everything and then I find a couple of orangutans and then you come and pick them up. Problem solved!\u2019 Right?\u201d\n\nBBC/International Animal Rescue Gatot, a young orphan, receives medical care. Ninety-five percent of animals arriving at the International Animal Rescue's Indonesia center are orphaned orangutan babies.\n\nIndividuals have a role too \u2014 \u201cyou know, us, normal people,\u201d Sanchez says. As palm oil consumers, we all need to put pressure on the private sector to do the right thing because we have power. If we stop consuming items, the whole system collapses. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue consuming as much as we do and pretend that we are going to protect the environment, it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d she says. \u201cChocolates, ice cream, snacks, Doritos \u2014 you know, you can live without them.\u201d Sanchez is hopeful there\u2019s still time to do something if we act fast. \u201cWe are this generation of people seeing this massive extinction of wildlife species happen, you know,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of at our fingertips and we are able to do something about it. Maybe it will be too late for the next generation. That\u2019s a big responsibility. But it\u2019s also a good feeling. That\u2019s what keeps us going.\u201d\n\nBBC/International Animal Rescue After humans, orangutan babies have the longest childhood in the natural world."

			"text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Sushma Swaraj's relationship with the chirping Twitterati was never painless. When Swaraj announced her presence on Twitter in December 2010, her nemesis appeared in the shape of Suhel Seth, a self-described \"bon vivant, traveller, author, marketing maven\" as per his Twitter bio.\n\n\"Can someone like Sushma Swaraj be on twitter because twitter has IQ barriers?\" Seth acerbically asked, in a tweet now deleted, but reported in The Telegraph on Dec 2, 2010.\n\nSuhel, isn't a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but his close friends are \u2014 notably senior minister Arun Jaitley. Back then, as leaders of opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Swaraj and Jaitley were seeking to position themselves as the BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate. (A battle that was famously won by Narendra Modi).\n\nAs the elections drew nearer, Swaraj had a scrap with her BJP colleague and now defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman. In the Parliament session just before the 2014 polls, Swaraj claimed a share of the credit for Telangana's birth, not wanting the Congress to be the sole claimant. Sitharaman, whose husband's family is from Andhra, retweeted a tweet to express Andhra's collective anguish.\n\n\"@saikumar_k: @nsitharaman If only Shushma had stood for Seemaandhra in Lok Sabha just like Venkaiah & Jaitley did today.\" @arunjaitley \u2014 Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) February 20, 2014\n\nAs Nirmala's retweet went viral, Sushma hit back. \"With Spokespersons like @nsitharaman, u don't need enemies,\" she said.\n\nSwaraj subsequently deleted her tweet, Sitharaman didn't delete hers. The spat was widely covered in the press.\n\nNow, as BJP leaders jockey for influence in the run up to the 2019 polls, Swaraj's political isolation is evident. As foreign minister, Swaraj has been trolled for days, by Twitter handles followed by senior BJP functionaries, after her ministry transferred a passport officer in Lucknow for allegedly humiliating a Hindu-Muslim couple.\n\nBiased decision #ISupportVikasMishra shame on you mam...is it effect of your islamic kidney?? \u2014 Indra Bajpai (@bajpai_indra) June 22, 2018\n\nHer party colleagues, the exception of a half-hearted gesture by Rajnath Singh, are silent. Even her few sympathisers refuse to commiserate.\n\n\"Prime Minister Modi and BJP president (Amit Shah) are trolled nastily by the Left-Liberals for years,\" one said. \"The BJP has ignored them and gone on from strength to strength. Sushma need not have made a production of her so-called victimisation.\"\n\nThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), too has disowned Swaraj, who was once a Sangh favourite. Rajiv Tuli, the RSS's Delhi spokesman, spoke for the paterfamilias when he insinuated that Swaraj had crossed the bounds of discipline:\n\nGovernments may come n go, ministers @SushmaSwaraj ji may come n go but policies & procedures should not be bypassed, should remain supreme. It is really bad governance. https://t.co/yoBCZGUsle \u2014 rajiv tuli (@rajivtuli69) July 2, 2018\n\nShould the BJP win a second term in 2019, Swaraj is unlikely to be part of the BJP's plans. A new generation of women leaders such as Smriti Irani, Sitharaman, Meenakshi Lekhi and Anupriya Patel (though she's from an ally, the Apna Dal) have grown into formidable entities.\n\nSwaraj, conversations with ruling party members indicate, may not even get a ticket to fight the next Lok Sabha. Her marginalisation is the most recent indication of Modi and Amit Shah's meticulous quest to exert complete control over all aspects of a party once known for its many leaders.\n\nHindustan Times via Getty Images\n\nAdvani's Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\n\nAlthough Swaraj's political style is often compared to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, her rise in the BJP owes as much to the mentorship of LK Advani in an era when his writ was seldom challenged. At a time when women in the BJP had to be content playing adjutants to the males and had limited ambitions, Swaraj emerged a prima donna: brimming over with confidence, doughty, articulate, and intelligent.\n\nLike Vajpayee, she quoted verses from Hindi literature's doyens in the proper context. Like Vajpayee, she was never a party person, she never created networks of support from within the BJP organisation or raised a coterie, convinced that like him, she would scale the heights on the back of her oratory and charisma which remained bountiful for years. While Vajpayee ruptured his facade of \"liberalism\" with a rank communal speech he made, Swaraj was indifferent to the tactics of religious polarisation. But she never once spoke out against the BJP-RSS's culture of communal divisiveness \u2014 a culture whose online avataar has now turned against her.\n\nHer sole misstep came after the Congress won the 2004, and Sonia Gandhi looked like she was about to be seated as the Prime Minister. Swaraj went apoplectic and declared that if Gandhi moved into South Block, she would shave her head, don an ascetic's robes and eat \"channa\" for the rest of her life. An industrialist from the east called on Swaraj, bearing an entreaty from the Congress's leadership to ease Sonia's path but to no avail. For a long time, Swaraj became the butt of jokes within the BJP until she worked overtime to reach out to Gandhi and just about befriended her.\n\nBut their convivial chats on sarees and health issues inside Parliament were construed negatively by the BJP's hardliners who deduced that Sushma was \"over-friendly\" with Gandhi and not adversarial enough to confront the Congress in the 2014 elections. Swaraj was out of the RSS-BJP's shortlist of PM contenders shortly after this campaign gained traction.\n\nShe got the foreign ministry alright, but Modi ensured that her part was pruned and pared to that of an agony aunt who was available at a moment's notice to rescue Indians trapped in conflict-ridden zones abroad.\n\nAt the pinnacle of her power, Swaraj leveraged her proximity with Advani to refuse party posts when they came her way and extract plum ministries in Vajpayee's cabinet (against his wishes). When Swaraj rebuffed the offer to become a BJP general secretary, because another female compatriot, Sumitra Mahajan (now the Lok Sabha Speaker) had held it before becoming a minister, Advani was upset and would not pull strings to get her back in the cabinet after she was out briefly to lead a Delhi election that the BJP lost.\n\nSwaraj became impatient with her benefactor. At a BJP national executive in Nagpur in 2000, she castigated the government's Kashmir policy before the press, leaving Advani, then the home minister, red-faced. Thereafter, he worked hard to get his enraged prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a ministry.\n\nCut to 2014: Swaraj was among those who never concealed her distaste for Modi and Shah. Indeed, after the spectacular win that year, she termed it as a \"pure BJP victory\" and refused to acknowledge Modi's leadership and role. The buzz was Modi didn't want her in his cabinet but the prime minister, party source said, was \"prevailed upon\" to induct her in a ministry befitting her stature within the party.\n\nShe got the foreign ministry alright, but Modi ensured that her part was pruned and pared to that of an agony aunt who was available at a moment's notice to rescue Indians trapped in conflict-ridden zones abroad. Foreign policy was handled by him and his national security advisor, Ajit Doval. So badly fenced out was Swaraj from policy-making-and-execution that she savoured that rare moment she got to personally interact with the deposed Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, his wife and mother when she was in Islamabad for the \"Heart of Asia\" meet in December 2015.\n\nShould the BJP win a second term in 2019, Modi will likely preside over a regime and not just a government. Meanwhile Swaraj, as the party's liberal face, is struggling to stay afloat in the BJP, the only party she has ever known."

Albert Square's many families provide plenty of drama, and the Beale and Carter families have had their fair share of tears and laughs in the episodes. Ian, Jane and Bobby Beale are at the centre of a lot of drama, and Phil Mitchell, Ronnie and Roxy are always battling something (or each other). In 2016, Stacey Slater and Martin Fowler have taken centre stage and the BBC One show has gone from strength to strength, with new executive producer Sean O'Connor taking the reins from Dominic Treadwell-Collins. Over the years, 'EastEnders' has provided TV fans with a number of iconic and memorable scenes, thanks to legendary characters Kat Slater, Alfie Moon, Peggy Mitchell and Pat Butcher. Recently, Kathy Beale made a shock return, after being presumed dead years ago, while Peggy Mitchell was killed off in an emotional suicide storyline. The soap's writers aren't afraid of tackling serious and sensitive topics, and in the last few years they have addressed rape, stillbirth, domestic violence, suicide and sexuality."

Candidates from the Babylon Brigade won two of the five seats reserved for Iraq\u2019s Christians in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections in May, and the group\u2019s ties to an Iranian-backed armed group has some Iraqi Christians concerned.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 A mostly non-Christian militia linked to a brutal Iranian-backed paramilitary group secured two of the five seats in Iraq\u2019s parliament reserved for Christians, according to official election results announced Saturday.\n\nThe militia, known as the Babylon Brigade, doesn\u2019t represent Christians at all, local leaders and international advocates for Iraqi Christians warn. They say the militia\u2019s candidates, though Christian, won only because of help from Shiite Muslims. And Iraqi Christians are calling on President Donald Trump to live up to his statements of concern for Middle East Christians by pressuring Iraqi authorities to invalidate the results. But so far, the Trump administration has said nothing on the issue.\n\nRayan al-Kildani, a Christian associated with various militias, founded the Babylon Brigade in 2014 when ISIS swept through Iraq and began hunting down religious minorities. Al-Kildani brought together 1,000 fighters and soon became the most prominent Christian in the popular mobilization, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias that fought ISIS with U.S. help. Along the way, he forged close ties with the Badr Organization, a historically brutal armed group that receives support from the Shiite leadership of Iran.\n\nMost of Al-Kildani\u2019s fighters aren\u2019t Christians, national security experts say, but members of the non-Christian Shabak ethnic minority or Iraq\u2019s Shiite Muslim majority. Al-Kildani\u2019s chief value to the mostly Shiite leaders of the popular mobilization forces was in propaganda. \u201cHe\u2019s used like a quisling character to put a Christian face onto these militias,\u201d said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East policy.\n\nAl-Kildani has \u201cnothing to do with the morality of Christ ... [and] does not represent Christians in any way,\u201d the church of Louis Sako, a top Iraqi priest who\u2019s now a cardinal-designate, said in a statement last year.\n\nAl-Kildani didn\u2019t win the parliamentary seats because of support from the Christian community but because of his ties to groups like Badr, his opponents fear. His candidates received thousands of votes from heavily Shiite cities that have no known Christian communities, said Asaad Kalasho, the U.S. representative for the Christian town of Tel Keppe.\n\n\u201cHe did get votes from Christians \u2026 [but] there\u2019s no way that he won based solely on those Christian votes,\u201d said Yousif Kalian, a program assistant at the United States Institute for Peace who has written on Al-Kildani\u2019s militia. \u201cMany [Christians] feel he doesn\u2019t represent their interests largely because of connections to Badr and to Iran.\u201d\n\nOne Christian party whose representatives had a post-election meeting at the State Department is formally challenging the seat allocation. And Sako said the results show Christians need to \u201clearn a lesson\u201d about securing political power.\n\nActivists believe that rather than advocate for the Christian minority, the Babylon Brigade\u2019s representatives in parliament will be most concerned with tipping the scales in favor of the Badr Organization, which secured the second-largest seat total in parliament. Kalasho said he sees the situation as evidence that the entire election was flawed \u2014 echoing complaints of irregularities elsewhere that the U.S. has said should be investigated.\n\nStrong representation, the advocates argue, is crucial to help Iraq\u2019s already struggling Christian community survive. Before the U.S. invasion unleashed waves of violence, Iraq had nearly 1.5 million Christians among its population of 38 million. Now only about 200,000 are left in the country, most of them in northern villages, the Kurdish region in the northeast and the capital, Baghdad.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been marginalized by both Kurds and the central Iraqi government over the years. Now it\u2019s Iran,\u201d said Steve Oshana, the executive director of the nonprofit group A Demand for Action, throwing in a reference to Trump\u2019s favorite geopolitical bogeyman. \u201cOur land has been stolen, our rights diminished, and if we lose legitimate representation in parliament, there\u2019s no coming back for us ... We\u2019ve been bamboozled, and it will take leadership from the administration to make sure it doesn\u2019t lead to our complete marginalization in our ancestral homeland.\u201d\n\nActivists said a strong response by the U.S. government is the only way to ensure that Christians still have their interests represented and prove that Washington will not tolerate attempts to suppress them. The White House and State Department met with Iraqi Christians worried about al-Kildani at least twice last year, Oshana said.\n\nMany in the Trump administration, particularly evangelical Christian darling Vice President Mike Pence, have said they want to help Iraq\u2019s Christians.\n\n\u201cAcross the wider Middle East, we can now see a future in many areas without a Christian faith. But tonight, I came to tell you, help is on the way,\u201d Pence proclaimed in October.\n\nBut the president has repeatedly told aides he wants to wash his hands of the Middle East and avoid pulling the U.S. into its communities\u2019 disputes.\n\nAsked to comment for this story, the White House, Pence and the State Department\u2019s office for international religious freedom were all silent."

She said 'maybe' there was casting couch in her time as well, however, people hear about it more often at present.\n\n\"It never happened during our time. Actually we started acting from school. From then only, all the films were hits. So there was no need for us to go to this person and that for a role,\" she said.\n\nShe added that there's a certain craze for films and hundreds of people land in Mumbai hoping to land a film, which is why the mention of 'casting couch' has increased in public conversations.\n\nHowever, she said that things have changed a lot for women who wanted a career in films. \"Back in our time, people used to think, 'should we let our daughter act in films?'. Now parents support their children. They are teaching them acting. So the approach has changed,\" she said.\n\nThe reporter then asked if women in politics also faced issues like 'casting couch'. To which, the actor answered, \"Wherever there are opportunities for promotion, maybe these things exist.\"\n\nJayaprada was expelled from Samajwadi Party in 2010 for giving public statements against the party's MPs."

			"text": "The Science Of Love In The 21st Century Eve Fairbanks\n\nOnce upon a time, in the Pony Expresso cafe in Seattle, a man and a woman began to experience the long-mysterious but increasingly scientifically investigated thing we call love. The first stage is called \"limerence.\" This is the spine-tingling, heart-twisting, can't-stop-staring feeling, when it seems as though the world stops whirling and time itself bows down and pauses before the force of your longing. The man, a then-44-year-old University of Washington research psychologist named John Gottman, was drawn to the woman's wild mane of black curly hair and her creativity: She was an amateur musician and painter as well as a psychologist like himself. The woman, a then-35-year-old named Julie Schwartz, who'd placed a personal ad in the Seattle Weekly that John had answered, was turned on by John's humble little car\u2014voted the ugliest vehicle in the University of Washington faculty parking lot\u2014and his expansive curiosity. He read physics and math and history and kept a little spiral-bound notebook in his pocket that he used to jot down things his companions said that captivated him. They talked avidly; it felt as if they'd known each other forever. Over the following months they drew closer and closer, proceeding through subsequent stages of building a fulfilling love relationship. John learned about the unhappy home life growing up in Michigan that had driven Julie to spend so much time in the forest by herself, and Julie learned about John's desire to understand deeply earth's biggest mysteries, like the nature of time. Although they were afraid\u2014they'd both been divorced before\u2014they confided their admiration for each other, John's for the courage Julie showed in her therapy practice by helping the \u201csickest of the sickest,\u201d schizophrenics and Vietnam veterans on Skid Row, and Julie's for John's absurdist sense of humor. They kayaked together. They joined a synagogue. They married and had a daughter, fulfilling one of John's longtime dreams, and bought a house on a forested island three hours north of Seattle, fulfilling a dream of Julie's. They fought. They attended couples therapy. Through their conflict they came to love each other more. Twenty-nine years after that first date, John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman stood on a black stage in a ballroom of the Seattle Sheraton in front of about 250 other couples, young and old, straight and gay. The intense intimacy of their relationship was on full display: They finished each other's sentences, bantered with each other and talked candidly about how their struggles had made them stronger. Julie wept. John held Julie, caressing her hair. The rest of us, seated in chairs that had been hooked together in sets of twos, watched them with yearning. We'd come to see the Gottmans because the pair has spent the last 20 years refining a science-based method to build a beautiful love partnership yourself. They reveal it over a two-day, $750-per-pair workshop called \"The Art and Science of Love.\" \u201cIt turns out Tolstoy was wrong,\" John told the crowd in an opening lecture. \"All happy relationships are similar and all unhappy relationships are also similar. \u2026 Is there a secret? It turns out, empirically, yes, there is a secret.\" Over decades, John has observed more than 3,000 couples longitudinally, discovering patterns of argument and subtle behaviors that can predict whether a couple would be happily partnered years later or unhappy or divorced. He has won awards from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Council of Family Relations and has become the subject of increasing public fascination. He went on Oprah and the \u201cToday\u201d show. A book he co-authored that summarizes his findings, Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, is a New York Times best-seller. His work took off because the consistency of his predictions is astonishing. One 1992 experiment found that certain indicators in how couples talked about their relationship could forecast\u2013with 94 percent accuracy\u2013which pairs would stay together. This was magic\u2013a virtually foolproof way of distinguishing toxic partnerships from healthy ones even before the couples knew themselves\u2013but it was also science, so it appealed to our contemporary desire to use empirical data to better our lives. Walk by any newsstand, or trawl the Internet for three minutes, and you\u2019ll find data-driven methods to improve everything we do. \u201cIs This the Ultimate Healthy Meal?\u201d \u201cThe Best Workout Ever, According to Science.\u201d You might expect love to be the last frontier breached by data. It is the Antarctic of the human experience, richly feeding the oceans of our emotions, yet somehow remaining elusive and unknown. Philosophers have argued over it for millennia without arriving at a satisfactory definition. Poets like Erich Fried capture its strange mix of pleasure and pain, the sense of its essential ungovernability: \u201cIt is foolish, says caution / It is impossible, says experience / It is what it is, says love.\u201d I first encountered Gottman's research last year in an Atlantic article called \"Masters of Love.\" It went viral; my own friends posted it on Facebook saying, \"This is what it comes down to.\u201d Finally, love had been harnessed in the laboratory, seen, understood and broken into building blocks we could all apply to our lives. The article proposes a recipe for becoming a love \u201cmaster\u201d instead of a love \u201cdisaster\u201d by responding the right way to what Gottman calls your partner's \"bids for connection.\u201d A \u201cbid\u201d is when your lover points out your kitchen window and marvels, \"Look at that beautiful bird outside!\" You could go \"Wow!\u201d and get binoculars (an active \u201cturn-towards\u201d); mumble \u201cHuh,\" and keep reading your newspaper (a passive reaction, less good); or say, \"I'm sick of your fucking birds. What about the broken garage door?\" Gottman found that masters turn towards their partners\u2019 bids 87 percent of the time. Love, he concluded, comes down to \"a habit of mind.\u201d And habits of mind take work to instill. Everyone at the workshop was given a kit in a box with a handle. Inside were decks of cards proposing questions to help us learn about our partners (\u201chow are you feeling now about being a mother?\u201d) or offering ways to connect erotically (\u201cwhen you return home tonight, greet each other with a kiss that lasts at least six seconds\u201d). A manual provided us with a vocabulary to demystify and contain some of the scary things that go on in love: fights are \"regrettable incidents,\" the things that make us feel good together are our \u201crituals of connection,\u201d the dark inner chasms that regrettable incidents seem to reveal are our \"enduring vulnerabilities.\" One of the Gottmans\u2019 employees, Kendra Han, estimated that a quarter of the couples in attendance were the kind of ickily self-aware duos who try this kind of thing for \"fun and enrichment\" while the majority were in some state of \"relational distress.\" The prevailing mood was a mix of hope and fragility. \"This is already not going well,\" I overheard one woman say, laughing a little. \"My husband\u2019s late.\u201d As I watched the Gottmans from my own seat two rows from the stage, I felt anxious, too. I had come with my own love problem to solve.\n\nSome traditional Arab cultures believed that when you fall in love, your lover steals your liver. The ancient Chinese told their children that love could take out your heart. Romantic love, in older human cultures, was often something dark. It involved physical dissolution, the sense of falling apart. It made us act irrationally and tore a hole into the neatly woven fabric of our lives, beckoning us to step through it into a land of terrors. \u201cYou get lots of stories of getting tricked,\u201d William Jankowiak, an anthropologist who has extensively studied love in folktales, told me. That\u2019s why, for much of human history, the marriage historian Stephanie Coontz writes, people thought lifelong partnership was \u201ctoo important\u201d to be left up to love. Marriage was a business contract. Families used it to acquire lands, to create stable legacies on which their next generations could build. Love resisted these kinds of reasoned considerations. That all began to change in the West in the 1700s. The rise of wage labor freed young people from their families and gave them more autonomy to decide whom to marry. The Enlightenment put freedom of choice into vogue. The word \u201cspinster\u201d emerged, a pathetic figure compared to blissful women in love. John began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. Simon May, a British philosopher who has studied the development of beliefs about love over two millennia of Western culture, suggests that we\u2019ve placed vastly more importance on finding love since the retreat of Christianity and the rise of relativism. \"Human love,\" he writes in his magisterial Love: A History, \"is widely tasked with achieving what once only divine love was thought capable of: to be our ultimate source of meaning and happiness, and of power over suffering and disappointment.\" The grounding we used to find in devotion to ideals like nationalism or communism, or in our faith in an ever-caring Shepherd, we now seek from individual, fickle human beings. After I read May\u2019s theory that love \u201cis now the West\u2019s undeclared religion,\u201d I began to see evidence of it everywhere. \u201cWhen you get down to it \u2026 [love is] the only purpose grand enough for a human life,\u201d writes Sue Monk Kidd in The Secret Life of Bees. At funerals, we praise the way the deceased person loved as the ultimate sign that his life had meaning. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Supreme Court opinion legalizing gay marriage nationally, identified marriage as the ultimate wellspring of all the other essential human joys, from \u201cexpression\u201d to \u201cspirituality,\u201d while Sheryl Sandberg counsels young women that their choice of a mate is the most important decision of their lives. According to May, we no longer view love as \"the rarest of exceptions,\" as older cultures did, \"but as a possibility open to practically all who have faith in it.\" These expectations are crazy-making, and it\u2019s no wonder scientists have jumped in to try to save us. In the 1930s, sociologists began to generate charts to try to predict what kinds of love marriages would last a lifetime. You could take your own personality traits\u2014loves sewing circles?\u2014and plot them against your beau\u2019s to forecast the happiness and stability of your match. 1 1 One of the first of these charts, created by Ernest Burgess in a book called Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, borrowed the variables from studies on whether criminals relapsed after being let out of prison. Starting the \u201970s, with divorce on the rise, social psychologists got into the mix. Recognizing the apparently opaque character of marital happiness but optimistic about science\u2019s capacity to investigate it, they pioneered a huge array of inventive techniques to study what things seemed to make marriages succeed or fail. They had partners write down everything they hated or loved about each other and then studied how close the pair subsequently sat together on a couch. They even generated fights, instructing couples to argue over how to pack the car for a vacation while each partner twiddled dials under the laboratory table assessing their mate\u2019s helpfulness. One study showed that couples who did novel things together fared better; another revealed that intense emotions, once believed to be a sign of immaturity in love, could be worked with to create very deep intimacy. Given how central our love partner had become to our well-being\u2014research had begun to show a good marriage was more predictive of long-term health than eating right or not smoking\u2014Sue Johnson of the Ottawa Couple and Family Institute told me she felt like she was \u201cin the most exciting revolution that\u2019s happened in the 20th century for human beings.\u201d \u201cImagine proving all those poets and philosophers from way back wrong!\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, we can make sense of love and actually shape it with deliberation.\u201d\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nOne recent afternoon, the Gottmans met me in their downtown Seattle office to talk about John\u2019s research and how they turned it into the Gottman Method. Julie was wearing a turqoise shirt and big earrings, her thick black curls streaked with a Susan Sontag ribbon of white. John, smaller and eagle-nosed, wore a black jacket and a yarmulke over a fringe of white hair. He'd brought his omnipresent scratch pad with him. \"A few years after we'd married,\u201d John began, \u201cI wanted to leave for Chicago to take a job there. But Julie felt Chicago was too flat. And then we were in that canoe\u2014\" Julie interrupted him sharply. \"Well, that came a bit later,\" she said. \"The real story here is we decided to offer a parenting support group. Remember that?\" \"Oh, yeah,\" John deferred. \"I forgot about that.\" Seeing the Gottmans' marital interaction up close is almost alarming at first. Most couples tone down the perpetual spats, adjustments, sideways glances and hopeful asides that constitute one-on-one intimacy when they're in public. The Gottmans don't. Sitting across from them at a conference table, you feel as though you\u2019ve come upon them tucked into bed, working it out with each other. They exchange constant meaningful looks. They interrupt each other, or Julie mostly interrupts John, correcting his behavior and memory. John accepts it. They use couples-therapy language. (\"Boundaries!\" Julie reminds John, when he starts speaking about his ex-wife.) They openly refer to deep wounds in their relationship. They also snuggle. John puts his arm around Julie, she arches into him and they wrinkle their noses at each other. In my presence, Julie wept twice, once recounting a time John had made her feel like a bad mother and once when John said she had been \u201cthe answer to my prayers.\u201d They started their parenting support group in 1989\u2013just 10 couples, once a week, talking about the ups and downs of having children at the Seattle Jewish Community Center. John approached it like a lab. \u201cHe was all about observing and learning,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnd I would jump in and talk about their emotions, looking for ways to try to help these parents. We'd have these great discussions afterwards and laugh about it. 'Why are you trying to help these people?' John would say. And I'd say, 'Honey, why are you not trying to help?'\" When John got his start researching couples in the mid-1970s, he was the one who needed help. He\u2019d grown up in Brooklyn and New Jersey a diminutive nerd with few friends. As an adult, his love life felt perpetually unstable and unhappy. He found it hard to be satisfied with the woman he was with. In one two-year relationship, he and a girlfriend argued so much he ended up with stress-induced pneumonia. Psychology, which he studied at the University of Wisconsin, gave him a way to use his problem-solving mind to attack the question of his own loneliness. Like a science-fiction android who pins electrodes on his human subjects to try to figure out where their emotions come from, John set about creating experiments that were as broad as possible: What does a good relationship look like? What does it feel like to be in it? His career took off when he met a psychologist named Robert Levenson. Each man turned out to be exactly what the other had needed. Levenson was investigating the remarkable variance in how different people react to stress by testing their heart rates and sweat-gland activity after receiving a jolt. By teaming up with John, he says he finally felt as if he was working on something more \u201cpersonally relevant and emotionally rich\u201d than administering electric shocks. Meanwhile, by joining with Levenson, John thought he might uncover a way to measure marital happiness that was more \u201creal\u201d than people\u2019s self-reporting on surveys. Their collaboration led John to create an actual mock apartment where couples could do \u201cordinary\u201d things like cook and watch TV together. \u201cIt was just like being at a bed and breakfast,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept you were hooked up to electrodes \u2026 and there were surveillance cameras hanging from the ceiling.\u201d Then, he harnessed the emerging power of computers to analyze a vast amount of data from the interactions. Professionals trained in interpreting facial expressions evaluated hours of video, rating the couples for emotions like delight, disgust and fear; assistants coded questionnaires the partners filled out about their relationship history for positive and negative feelings; and machines took constant measures of the couples\u2019 heart rates and vascular tone while they flirted and fought. Years afterwards, the psychologists followed up to see which couples were happy and which had split up. They plugged that information into a computer, along with all the data they\u2019d previously gathered, and asked the machine to create equations that associated certain behaviors and physiology with long-term happiness. What emerged were fascinating and often surprising observations on lasting love. They found that couples that stay happy used a lot of \u201cwe,\u201d whereas couples that turned out unhappy used \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d They also discovered that when partners with a good long-term outlook argued, they somehow managed to maintain a ratio of five positive comments to one negative one. \u201cAt the time, everybody was enamored with this idea that romantic relationships were full of fireworks,\u201d Levenson remembered. \u201cWell, that was not the finding. It is the capacity of couples to calm down, to soothe, to sort of reduce the level of arousal for each other, that is the most important factor in predicting whether the marriage will last.\u201d In the beginning, the two men\u2019s techniques were viewed as dangerously iconoclastic. \u201cWhen Bob and I were assistant professors getting evaluated for tenure our committee said, \u2018Look, you guys are crazy. We can\u2019t predict one person\u2019s behavior. How are we going to predict two people\u2019s behavior? You\u2019ll never find anything. You\u2019ll never get a grant,\u2019\u201d John recalled. But as the astoundingly robust predictions started rolling in, all that changed. John got elected to chair the family psychology research unit of the American Psychological Association. The New York Times profiled his findings. Where John had once felt hopelessly bewildered by love, he began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. \u201cJohn had these brilliant insights,\u201d Julie told me, \u201cbut nothing was being done with them.\u201d\n\nUnlike John, Julie\u2019s work as a psychologist had centered on therapeutic interventions. The daughter of a severely emotionally unstable mother, Julie started comforting others early. \u201cIn high school, I didn\u2019t have friends,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a caseload.\u201d She specialized in individual and group therapy, not couples therapy, but she was fascinated by her husband\u2019s research. She also knew that the majority of people who seek individual therapy want help with their relationships. From her divorce, she was familiar with the anguish produced by difficult love. She left that marriage with nothing but a Tibetan prayer rug, a sleeping bag and a cat. Canoeing together on the Salish Sea outside Seattle, Julie remembers saying to John, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try to help couples with what you know?\u201d They spent the next year creating a master theory of good relationships based on John\u2019s research. He sat in his red chair, she sat on an ottoman. \u201cWe argued a lot,\u201d John remembered. \u201cOh, God, we argued a lot,\u201d Julie said. In the beginning, John was hesitant to embrace some of the ideas about love that Julie had picked up from her decades of practice as a therapist. \u201cI thought, if there wasn\u2019t solid evidence, we wouldn\u2019t put it into the theory,\u201d he recalled. Always formula-driven, he imagined the Gottman Method would comprise a rigid set of 14 well-structured sessions. Julie wanted a looser set of guidelines. \u201cI was tearing my hair out because I had worked with people for 20, 25 years, and I knew that there\u2019s huge variation in how people react to therapy,\u201d she said. She threw John a teasing smile. \u201cHe had to learn how to respect my knowledge. Finally.\u201d They imagined that a happy relationship was built consecutively in seven layers. The foundation was a strong friendship, based on John\u2019s laboratory findings that couples who spoke more fluidly and in more detail about each other and their pasts were more likely to stay together. Then came sharing admiration, \u201cturning towards\u201d each others\u2019 bids and developing positive feelings about the coupling. Once that had all clicked into place, a pair could proceed through learning to manage their fights with, among other techniques, a process they dubbed \u201cdreams within conflict,\u201d whereby people try to see the positive dream inside what looks like a partner\u2019s negative position. At the top\u2013the pinnacle of a great relationship\u2013came helping each others' dreams come true and building a shared sense of purpose, like volunteering or traveling the world. The \u201cdreams with conflict\u201d technique was inspired by the Gottmans\u2019 own marital strife. One fight involved Julie\u2019s wish, for her 50th birthday, to climb above Mount Everest\u2019s base camp with 10 female friends. \u201cJohn gets altitude sick on a ladder,\u201d Julie said. He didn\u2019t want her to go. In bed at night, he\u2019d pepper her with questions: \u201cWhat if you get caught in a blizzard? What if you fall in a glacier? What if you get altitude sick?\u201d \u201cWhat if you get hit by a bus?\u201d she\u2019d reply. Julie invited a sherpa to their house to give a presentation on the trip. The sherpa stood in the living room, 6 feet tall, dark and sexy, and showed slides of fabulous rope bridges snaking over river chasms as her friends ooh-ed and aah-ed. Afterwards, Julie asked John what he thought of the evening. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that sherpa. I think he just wants to have sex with you 10 women,\u201d John recalled saying. \u201cI was right about that, by the way.\u201d But he came to realize what seemed like Julie\u2019s peculiar urge to \u201csleep on rocks where there\u2019s no air\u201d stemmed from her yearning for far-flung adventure born from her difficult childhood. They also fought over whether to buy a second home. It was a priority for Julie to return to living in the forest, her childhood safe space. John initially refused. Over many \u201cdreams within conflict\u201d discussions, they discovered that John\u2019s intransigence came from his own upbringing. His father, a rabbi, fled Vienna shortly before World War Two with \u201conly some sugar and a lemon.\u201d He counseled his son about the power of feeling free of possessions, including real estate, saying, \u201cThe only possessions you can count on are the ones inside your mind.\u201d Finally, after a year of bickering and breakthroughs, the Gottmans felt as if they\u2019d perfected their method, and they took on a partner to help them turn it into a business. At first, they recruited participants to their workshops by posting fliers and placing pamphlets in therapists\u2019 waiting rooms. But within a few years, such aggressive flogging wasn\u2019t needed anymore. Crowds flocked to the workshops and, later, to the Gottmans\u2019 online store, which offers products like a board game that takes you and your partner, represented by little plastic pieces, on a journey across painted cardboard through the steps to building a fulfilling relationship. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more of a burden placed on marriage now to be your social support system,\u201d Julie reflected. \u201cPeople turned out to be starving for this knowledge.\u201d\n\nI could relate. I met my boyfriend in 2009 at a dinner party I'd thrown to impress somebody else. He came in late, beautiful in his crisp work clothes. The chemistry was immediate. Over a series of dates, I learned he was sweet and giving, with strong ethics and a fascinating mind. We lived on separate sides of the country where we resided at the time, and we had heady months of meeting in romantic towns in the middle, eating figs and cherries we bought straight off of farms, learning about ourselves as we were reflected in each other. Much of the time, I think we made each other feel more capable, more hopeful for the future. But there were also times when we made each other feel more confused than we'd ever been in our lives. The desire to love each other was there, and yet it was with exasperation that we recognized we each sometimes didn't feel loved. What were we doing wrong? It didn\u2019t seem clear. During a difficult period this year, lingering at my laptop deep into the night, I found myself clicking on articles that promised to turn love into a formula. \u201c15 Ways to Stay Married for 15 Years.\u201d \u201cTen Ways to Make Your Marriage Divorce-Proof.\u201d \u201cMust-Know Guidelines for Dating an ISTJ.\u201d (Yes, I was desperate.) Like many people, I was particularly fascinated by a story in The New York Times called \"To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This.\" Based on work by Arthur Aron, a psychologist at Stony Brook University, the article proposed that love could be established if a pair of random people asked each other a specific set of 36 increasingly intimate questions (\"Would you like to be famous? In what way?\") and then silently stared into each other\u2019s eyes for four minutes. Two strangers paired for Aron's study actually ended up married six months later. It seemed to prove that love is a masterable technique rather than an uncontrollable force that often gives us pain. And people went wild for it. The article was viewed by more than 8 million people. Within weeks, Apple's App Store unveiled eight different apps based on it, one titled simply, \u201cFall in Love.\u201d And yet as fervently as I hoped one of these recipes would make my confused love life resolve itself, deep down I wasn\u2019t sure love could or should be built out of a manual, like something you assemble from IKEA. We live in an age that generally denies the possibility of the unpredictable. My and all my friends\u2019 unspoken goal is to live flawlessly plotted lives based on perfect self-knowledge. We have to-do lists and bucket lists and two-year, five-year and 20-year plans created with the help of therapists. One of my friends has jiggered his iPhone to blink him reminders of his \u201ccore values\u201d all day long, so he won\u2019t even briefly swerve astray. For me, though, love has been the thing that has broken me out of this dreary quest for perfection. We can only consciously construct what we can already imagine, which is very little. When I was 19 and living in Belgium, I happened to fall in love with a completely inappropriate man, a 33-year-old German pastor who wore white cigarette jeans like a \u201970s sitcom hustler and had spent his twenties bicycling around Europe. I never could have dreamed him up with the help of a therapist. That\u2019s what made loving him so life-altering. He was wild, irreverent, given to reading the Song of Solomon in bed and playing hooky from his internship at a theological seminary to take the train to a town he\u2019d never heard of\u2013in other words, nothing like the driven, well-scheduled East Coasters I\u2019d grown up with. And he touched those dormant qualities in myself. At the time, I wrote in a journal that being loved by him felt as if I\u2019d been living in only three cramped rooms of the mansion that was my spirit, and then he came in with a big flashlight and led me by the hand through a warren of never-seen halls, laughing and tearing the sheets off the furniture while I trailed behind him, mouth agape. Of course, his alluring differences also bashed painfully up against my longing for a partner with whom I felt comfortable all the time. He was too old, he was too odd, he smoked too much; I agonized over the thought of introducing him to my parents. I felt at the time that forcing our relationship to \u201cwork\u201d according to some norm would shatter it; it only worked insofar as it was broken, a queer, misshapen thing that just happened to rest beautifully atop the equally queer, misshapen circumstances that constituted our lives at 19 and 33. Likewise, surfing the web for the solution that would bring my more recent relationship to heel, I feared we couldn\u2019t make it conform to an ideal template. A recent Quartz article insists that when choosing a life partner, we have to search for the right \u201ceating companion for about 20,000 meals,\u201d \u201ctravel companion for about 100 vacations,\u201d \u201cparenting partner\u201d and \u201ccareer therapist\u201d\u2013all while admitting that contemplating such a project \u201cis like thinking about how huge the universe really is or how terrifying death really is.\u201d The author assures you, though, that using a spreadsheet will help you feel as if it\u2019s \u201cfully in your control.\u201d I guess this is supposed to be empowering; I suspect it actually puts relationships under a kind of pressure beneath which many would crumble. My boyfriend and I came from very different countries, from different kinds of families. That we managed to love each other at all was already a miracle. When we imagine thatevery human life and every complex love can be molded to fit a scientifically derived ideal, we cover our eyes to the realities of circumstance\u2013and shame people who can\u2019t manage to twist their circumstances to that ideal. Simon May, the philosopher who writes on love, told me that he\u2019s known people who were accused of basic psychological failings when they couldn\u2019t make their relationships work out. \u201cBut we have to take into account all the literature on unhappy love,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just people getting it wrong or not trying hard enough.\u201d He called love an \u201cearthy emotion\u201d that often provokes restless feelings like tension and guilt, and suggested the assumption that every love affair can be managed denies the full humanity of our partners, their own \u201cinscrutable and uncontrollable\u201d natures. They aren\u2019t things we can program for maximum impact like a FitBit. As I dug a little deeper into the work behind the love articles, I found that some of the people responsible for the science felt it held fewer definitive answers than we want to believe. One of them was Arthur Aron, the Stony Brook research psychologist whose work the Times glossed in \u201cTo Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This.\u201d He was working at his second home in California when I called him. He laughed when I mentioned the Times story. He\u2019d designed the 36 questions, he said, to artificially \u201ccreate closeness\u201d in a laboratory setting between same-sex heterosexual strangers, not lovers. One of his grad students had also tried the method on some heterosexual opposite-sex pairs, and one pair had, funny enough, fallen in love, but the lab hadn\u2019t followed up with the others. Aron has studied love in many other experiments, and he\u2019s been struck by how contextual factors influence relationships. \u201cUnfortunately the single biggest [factor], if you look across the world, is stress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re very poor, if you\u2019re in a crime-ridden neighborhood, it\u2019s hard for any relationship to work out very well. That\u2019s not one we can do much about as individuals.\u201d Aron also pointed out that a lot of the science on happy love was based on averages, creating a norm away from which couples can stray very, very far and still be happy. Take a recent study claiming the ideal age to marry is between 25 and 34. The study reflects the center hump of a scattered group of dots representing pairs older and younger that all work in their own way. And the reporting on it outrageously inverts causation. The study\u2019s authors mused that people who married younger might have been less settled, and those who waited until later might have been be more \u201ccongenitally cantankerous,\u201d upping their divorce rates. That doesn\u2019t mean arbitrarily marrying in your late twenties would do anything whatsoever to improve your chances. And yet, I still read a story on Vox headlined, \u201cWant to Avoid Divorce? Here\u2019s the Best Age to Get Married.\u201d John Gottman designed his experiments to allow numerous variables to emerge, creating a much richer formula. But his findings were limited by the pool from which he drew his test subjects, communities in Illinois, Washington, Indiana and the San Francisco Bay Area with their own local habits. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of big mystery at the heart of things,\u201d another psychologist told me. That psychologist was Robert Levenson\u2013the same man with whom John had pioneered his work. I reached him on the phone at Berkeley, where he now teaches. He and John are still close, and Levenson praised John\u2019s \u201cfierce interest\u201d in what makes marriages last. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that at the end of the day, after our research, he spent a significant part of his life working on interventions,\u201d Levenson reflected. But he wasn\u2019t so sure the actions he and John had observed happy couples performing could be turned into a do-it-at-home blueprint. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t know what got the happy couples to that point,\u201d he said. What makes two human beings want to turn towards each others\u2019 bids 87 percent of the time, give a shit about the fragile dreams hiding behind each others\u2019 most intransigent and frustrating opinions and have that magical effect on each other like a powerful chemical tranquilizer in the first place? This, he said, still \u201crequires scientific study.\u201d Kendra Han, the workshop employee, admitted she doesn\u2019t follow up after couples leave the conference to see whether the method made them happier. Two studies conducted by the Gottmans show that the method really can move people along a happiness spectrum: A 2000 intervention given to already-healthy couples expecting a child revealed that it helped them weather the difficulties of becoming parents, and a 2013 Journal of Family Therapy study of 80 couples showed that most maintained gains in marital satisfaction a year after \u201cThe Art and Science of Love\u201d workshop. This is less definitive than the promise to transform disasters into masters, though, and the method wasn\u2019t directly compared to other therapies. Robert Levenson told me couples-therapy purveyors can be reluctant to do comparative studies, and gave a hypothetical example of why based on the finding that happy couples use \"we\" a lot. \u201cWhat if I have the Levenson \u2018We\u2019 Therapy, where people come to my \u2018We\u2019 training and learn how to use \u2018We'?\" he asked me. \"Then I do a study and compare it with the Gottman approach and it turns out the Gottman approach does much better. But what about my \u2018We\u2019 building and my \u2018We\u2019 weekends and my \u2018We Retreat\u2019 at Club Med?\u201d\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nBack at the Gottman Method workshop, the 500 of us periodically broke out into pairs for exercises: 20 minutes to practice showing each other admiration, 30 to try to work through a serious problem that triggered our \"enduring vulnerabilities.\u201d There were tip sheets to draw out of our kits: a master list of 100 adjectives to choose from when praising our partners\u2014brave, reliable, hot\u2014and a collection of lines to use when we\u2019re overwhelmed during arguments. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m feeling flooded. Can we take 20? I\u2019d come in skeptical. But not two hours into the exercises, I found myself overwhelmed by emotion. All of the concepts were just abstract enough to find a specific analogue in my relationship. As I recognized my boyfriend\u2019s particular lovely qualities in the list of adjectives, I got a flush of warm and peaceful feelings, the kind John\u2019s laboratory research determined were necessary to support the calm physiology that underpins lasting love. A \u201clove map\u201d exercise got me to contemplate the gaps in our friendship and ways to fill them. The dreams-within-conflict exercise helped me understand the hopes for being a good dad that my boyfriend had vested in the ways he wanted to raise our future children. In their lectures, the Gottmans performed the same quirky, vulnerable marital dynamic that I observed in my interview. In one memorable hour, they role-played a past \u201cregrettable incident,\u201d first handling it in a bad way, then in a good way. As we all watched, John harshly criticized Julie for being too worried about their daughter\u2019s health. Julie slumped over the podium and actually cried. Then he started over with empathy, gently teasing out the issue from her personal history\u2013the polio she contracted as a child due to her parents\u2019 neglect. As we saw the change on Julie's face, we all drew a breath. Suddenly, altering the trajectory of those terrible fights, the ones that can feel as though they're breaking our partnerships apart, seemed possible. We saw it happen. It\u2019s not hard to find people who vow that the Gottman Method completely transformed their relationships. Last month, I called one of the thousands of couples-therapy practices that use the Gottman Method, BestMarriages in southern British Columbia, and asked for referrals to couples who were willing to talk. Several pairs emailed me, eagerly requesting to be interviewed. There\u2019s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore the awesome workings of destiny. Bonnie, 49, told me that she and her husband Brian, \u201cdefinitely a disaster couple,\u201d were going to end their union, but a year of biweekly counseling in the Gottman Method \u201ccompletely turned things around.\u201d Donald, 50, said he\u2019d also given up on his 24-year marriage to Donna. There had been affairs; the two had drifted apart. But encountering the Gottmans\u2019 lingo\u2014the \u201cenduring vulnerabilities,\u201d the \u201crituals of connection,\u201d the \u201cturning towards\u201d\u2014suddenly put meaning to the language-less, mysterious eddy of emotions that had been the relationship. It gave them things to do. Donald started sending Donna text messages every afternoon: \u201cHow was your day?\u201d When he had a difficult encounter with a testy colleague, Donna shared her admiration for him, telling him how proud she was of him for handling it well. When Donna had a cold and snored, the \u201cold Don,\u201d she said, would have roused her by \u201chuffing and puffing with annoyance.\u201d Instead, he employed the Gottmans\u2019 patented \u201csoftened start-up,\u201d waking her gently, expressing concern for her sore throat, and later sending her a note from work thanking her for rolling over to the other side of the bed. Talking to them by video Skype, I never would have known the two had struggled. They cuddled up to one another in the frame and giggled like smitten high-schoolers as they retold the story of how they met. \u201cWe spotted each other,\u201d Donna grinned, sticking her tongue out at Don. \u201cShe was on a balcony,\u201d Donald said, smiling back. \u201cIt was like Romeo and Juliet.\u201d I also got to watch Julie counsel a couple, Shantel and Paul, using the Gottman Method. The pair comes from a poorer neighborhood in Seattle, and they got free therapy in 2007 in exchange for agreeing to be filmed to help train other Gottman Method counselors. I\u2019d intended to dip in just for a few minutes to get a sense of how Julie worked. But I ended up viewing six hours of the counseling in one afternoon, transfixed. Though Paul and Shantel could hardly have seemed less like me and my partner in their particulars\u2013they had children; a low ebb in their relationship occurred after Paul got shot\u2013so much of the by-turns-playful-and-reproachful dance that they did with each other on Julie\u2019s couch reminded me of my own relationships: the flirty exchanges, the deep concern for each other, the subtle digs at each others\u2019 flaws, the sudden flares of anger as they touched each other on open wounds. Shantel wept as she recounted how Paul criticized her; Paul cried himself as he recalled being abandoned by his godmother and how he fears Shantel\u2019s rejection. I called Shantel in late July. Like the other couples I spoke to, she reckoned the Gottman Method \u201ckept us married.\u201d Since they\u2019d met as young teens, she and Paul had basically been each other\u2019s only ports in an incredibly stormy world. In his teens, Paul got involved in the drug trade; later, the pair got caught up in the predatory lending crisis and briefly became homeless. Add to that the fact that they had not selected each other to ride out this turmoil on the basis of a problem-solving-compatibility survey but on love, which often, like a trickster determined to upend our tidy plans, draws opposites together and, by reminding us of our emotionally fraught childhood bonds with our parents, brutally reveals just how vulnerable and childlike we really still are. Add to that the fact that our culture teaches us to expect love to \u201cfeel right,\u201d to feel like a peaceful resolution rather than an adventure, to feel as calm as faith. \u201cEvery time we got into a huge argument, we thought it must not be \u2018meant to be,\u2019\u201d Shantel said. Julie\u2019s techniques gave them a way to navigate the astounding complexity that is a marriage based on love. \u201cOne of the biggest things is being able to notice when we are \u2018flooded\u2019 and when we are at a place we can\u2019t even engage and giving each other that space,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe love telling each other when we\u2019re \u2018turning towards\u2019 each other. \u2018Hey, I\u2019m making an attempt here to turn towards you. What I did was wrong. It was unfair.\u2019 And the other person is receptive to that because we both have an understanding of what it means.\u201d In private, the Gottmans are much more nuanced on the impossibility of healing some relationships than they are in public. \u201cSometimes, really, people\u2019s dreams don\u2019t mesh,\u201d John reflected. \u201cThere are all kinds of reasons why therapy can fail.\u201d I got the sense they deeply care about couples in pain\u2014they asked me several times about my own relationship. Their promise that mastering love is possible is, in part, an effort to comfort couples enmeshed in terrifying complexity. \u201cEven if you can give somebody one little nugget of something they can take in, it\u2019s helpful,\u201d Julie said. I still don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to happen with my relationship. But I left the workshop wanting to try the Gottmans\u2019 techniques. They brought to mind a line from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian: \u201cThe truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. ... Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way.\u201d The new love science may be just a string in the increasingly huge and windy maze that is contemporary love, no more absolute than all the other ways of thinking about love we\u2019ve invented over 50,000 years\u2014but we need that string.\n\nBefore I left Seattle, the Gottmans invited me out to their home on Orcas, the forested island off the northwest Washington coast. A giant silver sculpture of a heart invites visitors down a steep, wooded path towards the sea. The house\u2019s interior is a wondrous world unto itself: wood carvings, ochre-and-sienna Native American-inspired throw blankets, shelves and shelves of books, a wooden dining-room table painted with playful injunctions. Enjoy the fruits of your labors. Open your mind. Seek knowledge. Seize the day. Cherish the night. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly Julie,\u201d John said proudly as we tucked our feet into sheepskin slippers. \u201cShe\u2019s a frustrated architect.\u201d He stopped in front of a huge oil portrait just off the foyer depicting the two Gottmans together, smiling and leaning into each other. A friend had painted it. \u201cI love this because it really captures our relationship,\u201d he said. He paused for a moment before the painting as if to take it in anew. Settling into their brown couches, I asked John and Julie if they felt the pain depicted in the millennia of literature on love, the ups and downs and the sense of bewilderment we now try to manage, was somehow necessary, or if better science could increase our skill at love such that we wouldn\u2019t have to go through such torment anymore. Both fell silent for 20 seconds. \u201cI think the pain has to do with balance, and how difficult it is to balance between attending to your partner\u2019s needs and staying true to who you are,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI have a different answer,\u201d John said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. When you haven\u2019t been able to build trust, there\u2019s the constant sense that this person isn\u2019t there for you. They\u2019re there for themselves but not for you. But we now know that there are really systematic processes through which people build trust and commitment.\u201d Recently, he\u2019d been working on the mathematics of building trust in relationships based on John Nash\u2019s concept of the cooperative equilibrium, where two players in a game seek the best possible outcome for both of them. But he also acknowledged that his painful younger relationships were steps on the path to Julie, showing him what he really wanted and how he needed to change. Julie said the same of her first marriage. If everybody involved had known then what you know now about how to build a good relationship, I asked, could you have made your earlier marriages work? \u201cNo,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d John said. There\u2019s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore not the scientifically based steps by which they built their coupledom but rather the awesome workings of destiny. I got the sense this story was more important to them than the other one. Revealing it, they curled closer together on the couch, Julie nestling her head into the crook of John\u2019s neck, John massaging her leg. Two years before she met John, Julie said, she\u2019d had a vision of the man she would spend her life with. Her vision had shown the man from behind. When John got up from the table to pay the bill on their first date at the Pony Expresso, and turned around, she felt a shock so sudden it left her trembling: It was him, the man from her vision. Later, she came to believe fate had brought them together for the higher purpose of helping couples: \u201cI see our predestiny, the sacred holiness, as to do this little tiny bit of healing as tikkun olam\u201d\u2013Jews\u2019 duty to repair the world. Julie\u2019s scientist brain knows that feelings of intense attraction come down to hormones and pheromones, but, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put that together with the fact that I had this vision of him.\u201d Perhaps, someday, a scientifically observable process will allow us to understand exactly what it is, that sense of mysterious destiny we can find in other people, not created but seemingly sent from on high. But is that a world in which we\u2019d actually want to live? John smiled as he recounted the puzzling sensation he experienced that evening in the Pony Expresso, similar to Julie\u2019s. He\u2019d been unhappy for decades. In the months before that encounter, he said he\u2019d gone on 60 dates, trying to establish a \u201cdatabase\u201d of women to choose from. And then he met Julie and felt unaccountably whole. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt alone since,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Julie murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me cry.\u201d\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax1_caption"

I\u2019d like to be a part of history.\u201d\n\nLater the same day, however, Markle talked to TMZ again, saying that he had major heart surgery scheduled on Wednesday that would prevent him from attending the ceremony.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Thomas Markle would reportedly not walk his daughter down the aisle. Kensington Palace told HuffPost on Tuesday that it still had no comment regarding the news or the change in plans.\n\nMarkle issued a statement Thursday confirming that her father would not attend the wedding, which means he won\u2019t walk her down the aisle.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u201d"

Do they have any medical issues? When were you told you would see them again?\n\nWhen Jaimes P\u00e9rez asks, \u201cHow are you feeling at this moment?\u201d he says most of the parents break down. \u201cPeople start crying,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cThey say, \u2018I\u2019m not doing well and I feel like I can\u2019t live anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s spoken with a mother who was separated from her 10-year-old son, who has a mental disability, and with parents who talk about committing suicide if they can\u2019t be reunited with their kids. His colleague recently spoke to a man who had hardly eaten since Border Patrol took away his 11-year-old son in late May. Through tears, the Guatemalan man said that if he\u2019s deported without his family, his son would \u201cdie of sadness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interview process is very horrific,\u201d said Jaimes P\u00e9rez. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as much information as possible from someone who is crying and someone who is distraught and who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nSince the Trump administration launched its zero tolerance immigration policy, Jaimes P\u00e9rez and other staff at TCRP have interviewed more than 300 migrants in an effort to reunite parents with their children. The TCRP workers send the information they gather to lawyers, who then visit migrants in detention centers to help them find their kids and shepherd them through the asylum process.\n\nTheir work is necessary because the government has admitted it has no concrete strategy to ensure that mothers and fathers can find their kids. (On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced an executive order that would stop the practice of separating families, but more than 2,342 children are still apart from their parents.)"

The goal of the global competition is to inspire recovery and rehabilitation among the athletes so they do not become defined by their injuries.\n\nA post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Jun 4, 2018 at 12:33am PDT\n\nThe first Invictus Games was held in London, U.K., but Orlando, Fl., and Toronto have also hosted the competition. Sydney, Australia, is also set to host the games later this year.\n\nThe games hold special meaning for Harry for two reasons. First, the prince revealed that the competition helped him overcome his fear of asking for help when it came to his own mental health.\n\n\"Actually going through Invictus and speaking to all the guys about their issues has really healed me and helped me,\" he said in a 2017 interview, according to ABC News.\n\nGetty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation Prince Harry congratulates the US team at the Wheelchair Basketball Finals during the 2017 Invictus Games.\n\nHarry previously revealed that he's suffered panic attacks during public engagements and that it wasn't until he completed two tours of Afghanistan with the British Army that he was able to finally confront his feelings about his mother's death.\n\n\"I have got plenty of issues. None of them really relate to Afghanistan but Afghanistan was the thing that triggered everything else and the process,\" he added in his 2017 interview.\n\nThe Invictus Games is also significant to the prince because that's where he made his first unofficial public appearance with then-girlfriend Meghan Markle. The couple, who are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, were spotted packing on the PDA in Toronto at the 2017 Games.\n\nGetty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend a Wheelchair Tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.\n\nMarkle has also shown her support of the games by attending the U.K. team trials and a reception for Invictus with Harry in April.\n\nNow that the two are married, we can expect to see Markle at her husband's side at both the 2018 Games in Sydney and the 2020 Games in the Hague."

			"text": "On New Year\u2019s Eve 2016, after years of berating myself, I finally took the plunge and decided to stop drinking for a year.\n\nMy drinking wasn\u2019t excessive, but it was enough to fill me with self-loathing and make me tearful and jittery the next day - even after just a couple of glasses. It was time to break ties.\n\nNow, as any of you who have tried to give something up - whether it be short or long term - will know it\u2019s pretty daunting. And, when it\u2019s something like alcohol, something that the very fibre of our society hangs on, it\u2019s tougher still.\n\nI started by writing a list of 50 reasons to stop. I figured if I could find that many reasons then there was really no excuse to carry on. You can read that hastily scribbled list here. I choose a year because I wanted to give myself a fighting chance and \u2019forever felt too long, too final.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned...\n\n1. I didn\u2019t feel amazing instantly\n\nThe first question everyone asks when you stop drinking is \u2018Do you feel amazing?\u2019 For me, it was sadly a no. I had expected to leap out for bed looking fresh-faced and consumed with boundless energy, however that wasn\u2019t the case. I envied friends who, after stopping for just a few days in January were already reporting feeling \u2018100x better\u2019. The energy took it\u2019s time to arrive but now, a year on, I definitely feel I have more mental energy and am starting to think about what else is possible in my life.\n\n2. Giving up for a year is easier than giving up for a month\n\nI found that when I stopped for a month in the past, the social pressure to drink piled on. \u2018You have to drink at XYZ,\u2019 or \u2018can\u2019t you just add another week on at the end?\u2019 As soon as I told people I was giving up for a year the pressure turned to congratulations. I lost count of the number of people who told me \u2018I wish I could do it too.\u2019\n\n3. The booze-free market is booming\n\nI\u2019ve yet to find a credible replacement for wine - everything is too thin, too sweet - BUT there are plenty of great 0% beers out there that can act as a placebo in the early days and I can\u2019t speak highly enough of Tesco\u2019s Virgin G&T\u2019s. Having forgotten what gin tastes like and having failed to get on the Seedlip bandwagon, I asked friends to road test the low alcohol G&T and it got thumbs up all round. At 0.5% alcohol it is technically a non-alcoholic drink but, if you wanted to split hairs, my argument would be that yes, there\u2019s a hint of booze in it - enough to kill the FOMO but not enough to give you a hangover in the morning.\n\n4. It\u2019s a mindset\n\nDuring the past year I\u2019ve attended a two weddings (my brother\u2019s and my best friend\u2019s) a hen weekend in Palma and a week-long holiday in France with three other families. In the past just one of these events would have been a reason not to give up in 2017. But, I knew that if I kept finding social excuses it would never happen. At the start of the year it seemed impossible that I could attend or enjoy those events without alcohol. The truth is I enjoyed them all the more hangover-free. I reasoned that it was no-one else\u2019s business what was in my glass, why should they care? And that thought, somehow, got me through.\n\n5. You find out who you really are\n\nAfter 20+ years of social drinking I wanted to know who I really was without it. That sounds a bit deep, right? I won\u2019t lie, I was pretty disappointed to find that I felt sad and miserable most of the time - was that the lack of booze or had the booze been masking / exacerbating a deeper problem? In the summer I eventually visited the doctor to talk about depression. It turned out I had low iron storage which left me feeling permanently exhausted. Now, as long as I keep on top of that, I feel fine.\n\n6. You are not alone\n\nAside from the public admiration of others I have been amazed by how many people have contacted me privately to say they have also given up drinking or are very close to it. One of the best things about this year has been inadvertently inspiring others. I promise you I am not anti-alcohol - I\u2019ve always said that if alcohol doesn\u2019t affect your life in a negative way then there\u2019s no need to stop. But it\u2019s messages like the one I received this morning (and that finally inspired me to write this blog) that make it all the sweeter; \u2018With your inspiration I have decided to do a year booze-free. I am both excited and terrified at the prospect. I need to stop using it as my crutch and the fact I feel the amount I drink is creeping up gradually. I would never had contemplated this last New Year. I envied you when you posted as I didn\u2019t think I could honestly go a week never mind a year. I am so scared but so excited for 2018. I have hid behind it for too long.\u2019\n\n7. You can do it, you really can\n\nNothing is impossible, certainly not what you choose to pour into a glass and then choose to pour into your mouth. There are a lot of people out there monetising this hot new trend (apparently the Millennials are turning their backs on booze in a big way) but you don\u2019t need to pay to do it. Take one day at a time. One weekend at a time. One social event at a time. Don\u2019t think of the bigger picture. Just get through each day and when you wake up feeling hangover-free, feel bloody proud of yourself and hang onto that feeling. You could also check out this free Club Soda Alcohol Free Facebook group.\n\n8. I\u2019m more confident now that I was before\n\nNow this one surprised me. People drink to give them confidence but I see now that I used to hide behind alcohol and wouldn\u2019t mix outside of my small circle. Now, when I\u2019m out, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m actually interested in having conversations with people - I honestly feel more confident now than I ever did before. Perhaps it\u2019s not worrying about making a fool of myself. Maybe it\u2019s knowing I won\u2019t wake up with \u2018the fear.\u2019 Whatever it is, I love it.\n\n9. Everyone wants to know...\n\n\u2018Are you going to carry on?\u2019 In January last year the thought of never drinking again was too big to contemplate, in some ways it still is. Over the past year I\u2019ve battled backwards and forwards, sometimes feeling \u2018ready\u2019 to drink again in 2018, other times scared I\u2019ll just fall back into the old bad habits. All I can say it that right now, waking up hangover and anxiety-free is enough of an incentive to carry on. As a new year approaches I\u2019m thinking of new challenges - I want to get fit again, blog more... and that, is enough for me."

Smelly, unique, creamy, delicious cheese.\n\nSimilarly, if you chat to any person about veganism, the thing they'll always say (aside from \"but bacon\") is:\n\nBut I just love cheese too much.\n\nOver the past few years, with veganism growing, some pretty awesome food manufactures have committed to making vegan cheese. So much so that if you browse your local health food shop or independent supermarket, you'll find an impressive amount of vegan cheeses -- from Brie and Gouda to classic cheddar and mozzarella.\n\nBut are these cheeses any good?\n\nWith the help of PETA, The Huffington Post Australia road-tested eight different vegan cheeses. Here's what we thought.\n\nHuffPost Australia\n\nTo preface this taste testing experiment, we wanted to make clear that it's important to stay open-minded when it comes to trying new foods, especially vegan alternatives. It's easy to class them all as 'bad' by nature, but this taste test was done with the intention of constructively criticising them.\n\nIf people who are vegan or lactose intolerant can find cheese that tastes similar to dairy cheese, that's awesome. Cheese for everyone.\n\n1. Parmesan by Angel Food\n\nThis powdered parmesan is vegan, gluten free, egg free and wheat free. Its powder base is made using coconut four, to which salt, yeast extract, vegan flavour for cheesiness and white pepper is added.\n\nYou can use this parmesan any way you like -- on pasta, mashed potato, sliced fresh tomatoes or beans on toast.\n\nHuffPost Australia Here is the vegan Parmesan and ricotta cheese in action.\n\nWe tried this powdered Parmesan on spaghetti and this is what we thought:\n\n\"Mmm, it's very salty.\"\n\n\"Parmesan cheese is my favourite type of cheese in the world, but not powdered cheese. I still like it, though I can tell the difference.\"\n\n\"It's salty but I would eat it. It smells cheesy, too. It makes me think: are you sure it's not cheese?\"\n\nPrice: $8.95\n\n2. Tofutti 'Better Than Ricotta Cheese'\n\nThe main ingredients in Tofutti's vegan ricotta cheese is tofu and oil, and it can be used on toast, in pies, lasagna, cannelloni and cakes.\n\nWe tried vegan ricotta cheese on top of spaghetti. Here's the verdict:\n\n\"It doesn't really taste like cheese. It's creamy and almost sweet. It's not cheese but it's definitely not unpleasant.\"\n\n\"I actually really like that. It's creamy and neutral tasting. Interesting.\"\n\n\"It adds a nice creaminess. This would be amazing in spinach and ricotta pie, or on toast with cinnamon and banana.\"\n\nPrice: $8.50\n\nHuffPost Australia\n\n3. MyLife Biocheese 'Cheddar Cheese Slices'\n\nThis vegan cheddar cheese is made using water, coconut oil, vegan flavours, salt and b-carotene for that cheddar colour. Like regular cheddar slices, you can use this vegan alternative on burgers, sandwiches and toasties.\n\nHere's what we thought of vegan cheddar cheese on a toastie with tomato.\n\nUncooked -- \"This feels like actual cheese slices.\"\n\nToasted -- \"It's really cheesy. I can't believe it. It's delicious. I can't tell the difference, I really can't.\"\n\n\"Mmm, it tastes like proper cheddar. It actually tastes and smells like cheese. I thought this was going to be a disaster.\"\n\nPrice: $10.20\n\nHuffPost Australia These two cheeses had the important melt, ooze and stretchy factors.\n\n4. Daiya 'Mozzarella Style Shreds'\n\nDaiya's vegan alternative to mozzarella is made from tapioca and arrowroot flours, plant oil, pea protein, natural flavours and salt. The cheese is designed to melt, bubble and stretch like regular mozzarella cheese, so it's ideal for pizzas, pastas and lasagna.\n\nWe added this mozzarella to some tomato toasties. Here's the verdict:\n\nUncooked -- \"Ooh, this feels a bit weird and rubbery. But it smells like mozzarella.\"\n\n\"It's good, but a bit nutty. It's very creamy and melty -- exactly what you want in a toastie.\"\n\n\"I want to go vegan but I don't want to give up cheese, but this is convincing. I would 100 percent have both of these cheeses [the BioLife cheddar] on a sandwich or toastie.\"\n\n\"It looks a bit weird. It tastes good but it doesn't taste like mozzarella. I mean, I quite like it. It's way saltier than mozzarella.\"\n\n\"I'm so impressed. It's not plastic-y or weird. This is so amazing. It's not even lying when it says that it melts.\"\n\nPrice: $14.80\n\nHuffPost Australia\n\n5. Green Vie 'Gouda Style' vegan cheese\n\nThis vegan Gouda cheese is made of water, coconut oil, starch, salt, vegan flavourings and b-carotene for colour. You can melt, slice, grate or cook this neutral tasting dairy free alternative.\n\nWe put this cheese in a toastie. Here's what we thought:\n\n\"This one smells a bit plastic-y.\"\n\n\"It smells quite like Gouda. It's got a pleasant smell.\"\n\n\"I think the texture is right, but it's not super flavoursome.\"\n\n\"If someone told me this was real Gouda, I would believe them. It's good, but I like the other two [above] better.\"\n\n\"I would never question that it's not cheese. A pleasant surprise.\"\n\nPrice: $6.50\n\nHuffPost Australia\n\n6. Sprout and Kernel 'Herb and Cashew Cheese Nut Cheese'\n\nSprout and Kernel's vegan cheese is made from cashews, buckwheat, oil, salt and mixed dried herbs and vegetables. This cheese would be great on a platter with crackers to let the zesty blend of herbs and spices speak for itself.\n\nHere's the verdict of the cheese when served on a platter with crackers:\n\n\"This is almost like a solid dip. It's herby, peppery, and the base is really creamy. Definitely yummy.\"\n\n\"This one is my favourite. It's not particularly cheesy, but the flavours are so well rounded and delicious.\"\n\n\"I would buy this and the first two cheeses used in the toasties.\"\n\n\"I think the texture is awful. It looks like it would have gelatine in it.\"\n\nPrice: $10.95\n\nHuffPost Australia No dairy, no worries.\n\n7. Damona Brie\n\nThis non-dairy brie is handmade in Melbourne using cultured soy milk, coconut oil, tapioca starch, miso, apple cider vinegar and Himalayan salt.\n\nLike the other cheeses, this vegan Brie was served as a platter with crackers. Here's what we thought:\n\n\"It feels like playdough and tastes like nothing.\"\n\n\"It's not offensive but it doesn't taste like anything. Just a cracker with plain mush.\"\n\n\"Nothing like Brie.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, it's got nothing. It's like having a decaffeinated skim almond milk latte. Just have a glass of water.\"\n\nPrice: $11.90\n\nHuffPost Australia\n\n8. Vegusto 'No-Moo Piquant Cheese'\n\nThis vegan piquant is made using water, vegetable oils, potato starch, yeast, rice flour, nut butter, rock salt, spice and vegetable flavouring. This style has a strong cheese flavour and is designed to soften when heated and not melt.\n\nWe served this cheese on a platter. Here's the verdict:\n\n\"This tastes very cheesy. Whoa. It has a slightly unusual aftertaste but it's very similar to regular cheese.\"\n\n\"I like it. It's a bit spicy at the end. This tastes like a cheesy cheese.\"\n\n\"This one's not bad. It's very cheesy.\"\n\nPrice: $11.50\n\nThere you have it. Excluding a couple, these cheeses are perfect for all lactose intolerant and vegan people out there who are missing cheese.\n\n\n\nYou can purchase all these cheeses from The Cruelty Free Shop online or in their store in Glebe, Sydney.\n\nClick below to follow HuffPost Australia on Snapchat!"

According to Reuters, there were over 3,000 people in the crowd, most of them Filipino workers living in South Korea.\n\nDuring the event, two women were called up to the stage to receive a book from the Filipino president.

			"text": "A24 Toni Collette and Ann Dowd in \"Hereditary.\"\n\nWarning: Spoilers abound. Like all great horror movies, \u201cHereditary\u201d requires time to process \u2015 a rumination period, if you will. The devil\u2019s in the details, and the details can be hard to piece together the moment Judy Collins\u2019 cover of Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d serenades the end credits. But it\u2019s also the kind of movie you want to understand \u2015 and the kind that seems to want you to understand it, even if writer/director Ari Aster told me he prefers \u201cthe David Lynch method of not explaining anything and allowing people to have their own experience.\u201d Aster can\u2019t abscond with that Lynchian model just yet. Lynch\u2019s macabre surreality doesn\u2019t invite concrete interpretations, but the more precise mythology of \u201cHereditary\u201d does. Having seen the movie three times, I will say that the clues planted throughout its first half \u2015 focused on the Graham family\u2019s slow-burning trauma \u2015 do pay off in its second half. Nonetheless, by the time demon worship has invaded the clan\u2019s bloodline, \u201cHereditary,\u201d which opened in theaters June 8 and has grossed a dignified $35 million and counting, still carries the sense that its many terrifying parts are haunted by an overarching WTF-ness. Across two interviews \u2015 one in person before the film\u2019s release, and one via email earlier this week \u2015 I asked Aster to elaborate on some of the plot\u2019s specifics, and to reflect on the public reception of the film, which premiered to exemplary reviews at Sundance but is finding its share of detractors in the real world. How did you settle on King Paimon as the movie\u2019s overarching mythology? I knew it was ultimately going to be a film that was going to be about a long-lived possession ritual playing out from the perspective of the sacrificial lambs. But when I first endeavored to do it, I was like, eh, it\u2019s like the devil, I don\u2019t know. The devil is played out. I just wanted to not do the devil again. [King Paimon] came out of research. That\u2019s a demon in demonology. I am not ultimately tied in any way to the occult \u2014 in fact, the research was kind of disturbing for me. But I also felt it was good to root it in something real. I take some liberties with that mythology. I\u2019m sure somebody who knows all about this stuff would take issue with a lot of the liberties I did take. And then in some ways there is a lot of very real stuff in the film, which for me makes it more disturbing. If you read a manual on how to do this stuff, the movie is following a lot of that, but trying to do it in a way that also evades doing it explicitly. I\u2019m not superstitious, but I\u2019m just paranoid enough to not want to actually invoke anything that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nA24 Ari Aster and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski on the set of \u201cHereditary.\u201d\n\nSince we see the ghosts of Annie\u2019s mother and Charlie, the movie at first seems like it will have a paranormal overtone. Did you ever flirt with the idea of building toward something more supernatural? No, not really. I knew I wanted to have all the seance stuff serve as misdirection so it\u2019s like going into a ghost movie. And there\u2019s a lot of stuff at the beginning of the film that suggests we\u2019ll go there, too, like Annie seeing an apparition of her mother that may or may not be something she\u2019s projecting. We plant a lot of hints to suggest that we are going in the direction of a dark ghost movie. The seance is a payoff of that, but really that\u2019s all misdirection because it\u2019s all a ruse that\u2019s being performed by this coven of witches that we\u2019re feeling throughout the film in the periphery. Are you going to put a spoiler alert on this? Because I\u2019ve read that a lot of people think the people at the end are ghosts, and they\u2019re not. Yes. It\u2019s a hard movie to talk about because everything that happens constitues something of a spoiler. Even revealing that it involves the occult is a spoiler. Oh, yeah. So, a basic point of clarity: Why does Annie need to die at the end, and who is possessing her to saw her head off? Well, literally, that\u2019s Paimon, but there should also be a feeling that she\u2019s doing it to herself. I want the film, and the family itself, to have this ouroboros quality. Right? It\u2019s eating itself. So what is she doing? She\u2019s doing to herself what happened to her daughter. There are a lot of things that are being kind of literalized: the fact that she resents her son, wishes that she wasn\u2019t a mother. That shadow self is suddenly given full rein, and she\u2019s chasing her son around the house. And then at the end she\u2019s punishing herself in a way that is absolutely in keeping with her character. And then, as a horror movie, it\u2019s literally just Paimon doing it. Like any good horror movie, the metaphor is operating, but it\u2019s not just the metaphor because that sucks. Tell me if this is an accurate summation: The grandmother wanted to pass the Paimon monarchy on to Charlie, but because it needed a male host, that\u2019s why it went to Peter instead. Yeah, more or less. It doesn\u2019t so much go there as people have engineered it to go there. Right. That Ann Dowd is up to no good. Where did you come up with the clucking of the tongue, and what does it signify to you? I mean, it\u2019s just a device. It\u2019s a device because we\u2019re going to lose that character soon but we need to have her hang over the rest of the film, and something auditory is very nice because it\u2019s simple and you can\u2019t place it. It\u2019s not tangible, but it\u2019s there. It just worked as a device. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to become this thing. Is it that the person doing the clucking is the one Paimon\u2019s followers are assigning the Paimon role to? Eventually Peter takes over the clucking, but it does continue in the space between Charlie\u2019s death and Peter\u2019s takeover, almost like it\u2019s coming from nowhere. And he only continues because, again, as a device, it lets you know what\u2019s going on without having to explain it. It lets you know who ... ... is inside of Peter. What did it mean to you to have Annie create the miniature of the car crash? This is where I kind of don\u2019t like to explain. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t want to answer, you don\u2019t have to. Well, no, no. I just hate the idea of sounding obvious. But Annie is somebody who is very much out of control in her own life, and I think over the course of the film it\u2019s revealed just how out-of-control she is. This is her way of seizing some semblance of control over her surroundings by basically replicating them and manipulating them. Really what\u2019s happening to her is she is like a doll in a dollhouse \u2015 and so is her family, being manipulated by these outside forces. It\u2019s her way of working through something. Maybe it\u2019s not the most healthy way, or the most thoughtful way. And it\u2019s probably akin to what I\u2019m doing here. What do the letters on Charlie\u2019s bedroom wall mean? They are part of an invocation spell that\u2019s being written all over the house. We only see a few of them, but there are more. Those are Latin. The line \u201cwe reject the Trinity\u201d \u2015 is that as simple as an expression of anti-Christianity? Yeah, for them. An expression of Satanism. Yeah. Or Paimonism.\n\nA24 Alex Woff in \"Hereditary.\""

This is according to recent research commissioned by Old Mutual Unit Trusts into the financial behaviour of employed millennials, which found that while 69 percent of them have a savings account, only 44 percent are investing in pension or provident funds.\n\nResearch by Britannica \u2014 which indicated that the life span for humans is now at least 114 years, almost double our expected retirement age \u2014 coupled with continued failure to invest could be catastrophic to millennials' dreams of achieving financial freedom, said Khaya Gobodo, managing director of Old Mutual Investment Group.\n\nMillennials tend to save money in formal savings products. Almost 61 percent of millennials surveyed were saving money in a bank account. However, bank accounts are seldom able to deliver the real growth required to beat inflation, whereas equity-based investment vehicles can protect and enhance the buying power of your money over the long term.\n\n\"Unlike saving, which is setting money aside to meet short-term goals, investing builds sufficient wealth to secure a second source of income to one day hopefully replace your salary, which is the ultimate goal of financial freedom,\" said Elize Botha, managing director of Old Mutual Unit Trusts.\n\n\"If no attempt is made to generate real wealth over time through investing, it will likely result in an over-reliance on the state in the future, creating a drain on the national budget, which will be catastrophic for the economy,\" said Gobodo.\n\nWhile saving without investing may feel adequate over the shorter to medium term, Botha explained that it just isn't sufficient to secure long-term financial security by saving alone. \"Even if they are saving quite well over time, millennials who fail to invest effectively are leaving themselves completely exposed to the risk of inflation, the most significant threat to their hard-earned savings.\"\n\n\"Reduced long-term investing coupled with time out of the market leads to a loss of compound interest in savings for retirement,\" added Gobodo.\n\nThis is particularly worrying when considering, for example, that older generations who are currently retiring still do not have sufficient funds. \"Despite many of these people having spent most of their working years with one employer, compounding their retirement savings over 30 to 40 years, there is still a significant shortfall,\" he said.\n\nA generation of millennials, on the other hand, who are not looking to spend much time in one company, may be tempted to withdraw retirement savings, for example, on resignation and lose out on the power of compound interest. On top of this, the transaction costs and penalties they pay to tax for withdrawing before retirement further diminishes the savings they will be left with post-retirement.\n\nThanks to the power of compound interest, the longer your money is invested, the more time it has to grow \u2014 and this is why going beyond saving, by investing, is a great step."

Accusing Ansari of carrying beef in his car, the cow vigilantes beat him mercilessly and set his vehicle on fire.\n\nEleven men, including a BJP leader named Nityanand Mahto, were convicted of murder and handed life sentences by a fast track court in March.\n\nArfa Khanum Sherwani/Twitter\n\nWhen they were convicted, Singh, who is in charge of the civil aviation portfolio at the Centre, had called for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. \"I firmly believe that complete justice has not been done,\" he said.\n\nAfter the Jharkhand High Court suspended the life sentences on June 29 and granted them bail, the eight men walked out of the Jai Prakash Narain Central Jail and headed to the residence of the minister. News18 reported that they were led by a BJP leader, Amardeep Yadav, who is also the OBC Morcha president of the party.\n\nYadav said that Singh had always believed the convicted men were framed in the case. \"That's why he provided legal and monetary assistance to them in his personal capacity. There is nothing wrong in supporting innocent people,\" he said.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in Jharkhand, Hemant Soren, tweeted, \"This is despicable.\"\n\nCongress Party's Ajoy Kumar, a lawmaker from the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha constituency, said, Singh was regarded \"among the most educated minister in PM Modi's cabinet.\" \"Do they have no work to show except playing politics on dead bodies and dividing society,\" he said.\n\nThis is truly despicable. @Harvard Your alumnus @jayantsinha felicitating the accused in cow related lynching death in India.

It's a new person, it comes with new beats. Old tricks become new tricks again \u2014 you know, being charming and romantic, all of that. I think I'm more balanced today.\"\n\nIn a different interview, he said when you're in love, even \"water tastes like sherbet.\"\n\nEarlier today, in an interview with The Telegraph, the actor said, \"After so many years of being in films, I've come to realize that I need a life beyond films and some personal space. The relationship keeps me grounded and has value for me. Tomorrow, I may reach different heights of superstardom or might end up as a big failure, but that should not matter to me. What should matter are the relationships I've built in life \u2014 I also want to get married and have my own tribe.\"\n\nBhatt too has expressed her desire to get married.\n\nKapoor also requested the media to 'respect their privacy' and not 'make a mockery of their relationship.'\n\n\"We don't want to make a mockery of it and make it a reality show, but just to put things in perspective and that this is happening \u2014respect my privacy and respect the fact that I'm sharing this with you,\" he said.\n\nKapoor, just like her cousin Kareena, has been relatively open about his relationships. He was vocal about dating Deepika Padukone but maintained a stoic silence during his romance with Katrina Kaif, who he lived in with for over 2 years.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

Sanju, as a result, is an entertainer that delivers more than just the superficial goods one expects from a mass entertainer. It sets a new benchmark for Bollywood biopics. It will be a hard act to follow.\"\n\nRachit Gupta of Filmfare said, \"Like all of Rajkumar Hirani's films, Sanju is detailed, well-written and has plenty of memorable moments. The father-son saga, the many references to old Hindi film music and lyricists is fantastic. With Sanjay Dutt's biopic, Hirani has been able to put his personal friendship aside and present an engaging story with the kind of finesse it needs.\"\n\nA review on Firstpost said, \"Sanju is an entertaining film, and has all the elements of a blockbuster \u2014 but one wishes the honesty and nuance went beyond just the performances.\"\n\nHowever, Anna Vetticad, veteran film journalist, criticised the film for its 'startling dishonesty'. She wrote, \"The object of the film is two-fold: to project Dutt as a misguided but well-intentioned man and all-round nice guy, and to scapegoat others for his failings. So yes, he was not committed to his work, but c'mon, what is bechara Baba to do when he is under so much strain to match his father's greatness?\"\n\nRajeev Masand pointed out the same. He wrote, \"What's a little troubling, however, are the excuses made for Dutt's failures and misdeeds. Sure he's alternately portrayed as selfish, insensitive, self-destructive, and entitled at various points in the film, but it's all part of a larger narrative in which Dutt is always the victim.\" He gave it 3.5 stars.\n\nA 2.5-star review on Hindustan Times said, \"Hirani mostly focuses on the events of Dutt's life, beginning with his well-chronicled struggle with drugs. The director's usual humorous style is evident from the first scene, and Ranbir Kapoor is probably his only tool to infuse intensity into Sanju.\"\n\nA review on the trade website Koimoi.com said, \"All said and done, Sanju entertains, surprises & blows your mind. Ranbir Kapoor stays in the zone & rules it. Vicky Kaushal is going to fly high after this one. Rajkumar Hirani achieves the excellence 5th time in a row!\"\n\n(This story will be updated as more reviews trickle in)"

In exceptional circumstances, terminations up to 24 weeks will also be permitted.\n\nThe government hopes the new abortion regime will become law by the end of the year.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday in the wake of the referendum result, Varadkar said the vote marked \"the day Ireland stepped out from under the last of our shadows and into the light\".\n\n\"Today, we have a modern constitution for a modern people,\" he added.\n\nWhat does this mean for Northern Ireland?\n\nFollowing the result in Ireland, focus has now turned to north of the border.\n\nDespite being in the UK, abortion is effectively illegal in Northern Ireland, and is barred even in cases of incest and rape.\n\nThe DUP has signalled its opposition to the relaxation of abortion laws, with the party's leader Arlene Foster saying Ireland's referendum has \"no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland\".\n\n\"A referendum was held in the Republic of Ireland because of the constitutional prohibition on abortion that existed there. No such constitutional bar exists in Northern Ireland,\" Foster said.\n\n\"The DUP is a pro-life party and we will continue to articulate our position. It is an extremely sensitive issue and not one that should have people taking to the streets in celebration.\n\n\"I want to see the Northern Ireland Assembly restored and put no preconditions on the immediate establishment of an executive.\n\n\"Some of those demanding change are the same people blocking devolution or demanding that Westminster change the law whilst simultaneously opposing direct rule.\"\n\nBut other politicians and activists have voiced their support for relaxing the country's stance on abortion.\n\nAt Dublin Castle, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O'Neill held up a banner with the words: \"The North is next.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tory education minister Anne Milton told ITV's Peston On Sunday she will back liberalisation of Northern Ireland's abortion laws.\n\n\"I understand there was a survey last year that showed a majority for a change in the law in Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\n\"It does feel anomalous and we are offering abortions for women from Northern Ireland (in England), that doesn't feel quite right.\n\n\"It will be for the Northern Irish to reflect on.\"\n\nGiven there was no assembly, she said if an amendment was put forward by an MP there should be a free vote and \"personally, I believe in a woman's right to choose\"."

			"text": "The web is slowly, but surely taking over as the most happening platform as far as the world of entertainment is concerned. There is no denying that at present some of the best movies and series are being produced/distributed by web giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. After a roller-coaster ride in 2017, the new year too has started on a brilliant note for the netizens with some great content that has been released recently.\n\nHere is a compilation of the five best new shows on the web that you must watch.\n\n1. Altered Carbon\n\nThis Netflix original futuristic series oozing with cyberpunk detail is easily the most intoxicating and cerebral stuff available right now. Created by Laeta Kalogridis, Altered Carbon is based on the 2002 novel of the same name by Richard K. Morgan. The sci-fi series is set in a future where human consciousness is digitised and stored, thereby allowing it to be transferred from one body to another. Altered Carbon is not just about fancy gadgets and impeccable graphics. For, it offers a great critique on materialism, class divide, and morality. Altered Carbon forces us to question the very meaning of life and what it means to be human. The ten-part series is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n2. McMafia\n\nCurrently streaming on Amazon Prime in India, McMafia is inspired by Misha Glenny's 2008 non-fiction book McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld. The eight-part series is created by Hossein Amini and James Watkins. While its premise does bear some similarities to The Godfather (1972), McMafia's contemporary setup and realistic characters make it quite unique. While the series essentially deals with the Russian Mafia, it is nothing like Eastern Promises (2007).But what makes it interesting is how it focuses more on businessmen, bankers, money launders and pimps rather than on gangsters. The USP of the series as far as the Indian audiences are concerned is Nawazuddin Siddiqui's menacing portrayal of Dilly Mahmood\u2014the greedy Indian handler of an Israeli shipping tycoon.\n\n3. Mosaic\n\nDirected by Steven Soderbergh, Mosaic is a six-part murder mystery series starring Sharon Stone in the lead role. Currently streaming on Hotstar in India, Mosaic is written by Ed Solomon, known for his work on Men in Black, Charlie's Angels, and Now You See Me. Mosaic is smart, stylist and effective, just as one expects from someone like Soderbergh. Sharon Stone is mesmerizing to watch as the charismatic children's book author Olivia Lake. Stone plays her Olivia with effortless ease, adding great subtlety and depth to her character. If you have a thing for whodunits then Mosaic is right up your alley.\n\n4. Breathe\n\nDirected by Mayank Sharma, Breathe is an eight-part original series produced by Amazon Prime. Breathe is a gritty psychological thriller that focuses on the lives of ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances. The series stars R. Madhavan and Amit Sadh in the lead roles. While the former plays a father desperate to find a lung donor for his dying son, the latter plays a maverick cop with questionable methods. Breathe raises some serious questions about morality and fate and brings our attention to issues which we usually tend to overlook. If you like thrillers then Breathe will certainly not disappoint you.\n\n5. Everything Sucks!\n\nThis Netflix original coming-of-age comedy drama series is a parody on the teen culture of the mid-1990s. Created by Ben York Jones and Michael Mohan, Everything Sucks! Revolves around a group of High School teenagers and offers an interesting take on the notions of dating and sexuality. The USP of the series are the superb performances of the ensemble cast that features the likes of Jahi Di'Allo Winston, Peyton Kennedy, Patch Darragh, Claudine Mboligikpelani Nako, and Rio Mangini. Oozing with nostalgia, the series makes for an engaging viewing experience, especially for those who grew up in the '90s. The ten-part series is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nA version of this article was first published in A Potpourri of Vestiges.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b(The opinions expressed in this post are the personal views of the author.

But it's hard to ignore the many ways in which the event is, and always has been, incredibly gendered.\n\nWhile many are criticizing the sexual harassment and sexism pervasive at this year's World Cup, sexism in the world of sports (or anywhere) is nothing new at all. But seeing how the World Cup is currently in its throes, there's no time like the present to take a look at some of the many shocking ways in which this year's mega-event has truly crossed the line, including for sports journalists that are women.\n\nJulia Guimar\u00e3\n\nOn Sunday, Julia Guimar\u00e3es, a sports reporter for Brazil's TV Globo and sportv, had to scold a man who tried to kiss her during a live report in front of a stadium in Yekaterinburg before the Senegal-Japan match. She successfully ducked the idiot and proceeded to tell him off as her mic was cut. \"Don't do this,\" she said. \"I don't allow you to do this, never, OK? This is not polite. This is not right. Never do this. Never do this to a woman, OK? Respect.\"\n\nGreat response from Brazilian TV journalist Julia Guimaraes of Sportv to unacceptable behaviour. Not easy to show such restraint in the face of harassment. pic.twitter.com/eFVZz6gdMA \u2014 Colin Millar (@Millar_Colin) June 24, 2018\n\nGuimar\u00e3es later tweeted that it's \"hard to find words,\" and that similar incidents had also happened to her twice already in Russia, one of these at the Egypt-Uruguay game. \"It's awful. I feel helpless, vulnerable. This time I gave an answer, but it's sad, people do not understand. I wanted to understand why you think you have a right to do that,\" she said, according to a translation.\n\nJulieth Gonzalez Theran\n\nBerlin-based Colombian journalist Julieth Gonzalez Theran was groped and kissed during a live-air broadcast at the World Cup. It happened fast. As she was giving a live report from Moscow, a man appeared out of nowhere, grabbed her breast and kissed her on the cheek. She continued with her report, fully ignoring the guy, but later expressed her outrage on Instagram.\n\nClaudia Neumann\n\nClaudia Neumann is the first woman ever to narrate a men's World Cup game for German public broadcaster ZDF. Sadly, and unsurprisingly, Neumann has experienced a barrage of hatefully sexist online abuse and criticism from male fans.\n\nAt the start of this year's World Cup, she responded to the internet hate calmly. \"No, I do not care about it,\" she said, adding that the internet hate represents only a \"minority that receives a lot of attention.\"\n\nBurger King's \"controversial\" World Cup ad campaign\n\nYo, check out this: Burger King Russia's ad was honestly and truly offering money and free burgers to Russian women impregnated by Russian World Cup players. Unsurprisingly, it was removed after people, you know, reacted.\n\n\"Each will receive 3 million rubles [$47,000 USD],\" said the ad, \"and a lifelong supply of Whoppers. For these girls, it will be possible to get the best football genes and will lay down the success of the Russian national team on several generations ahead.\"\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether or not this next-level vile ad was a response to comments made by Russian politician Tamara Pletnyova, who urged Russian women not to have sex with foreign World Cup visitors, I'm calling multiple isms on this one either way. Burger King has since issued an apology, but, um, where to even start?\n\nGetty Images joins the party too, because why not\n\nIf I haven't sufficiently rained on your World Cup parade just yet, Getty Images posted a gallery of photographs titled \"World Cup 2018: The Sexiest Fans,\" comprised entirely of shots of (conventionally) attractive (and in most cases, scantily clad) women. They, of course, came under the gun after that for not feeding their straight women (or gay/bi men) viewers any eye candy whatsoever, and seemingly mocking the concept of women enjoying sports. Getty has since removed the gallery and issued a brief apology.\n\nBrazilian UN Women issues a statement\n\nThe many misogynist incidents at this year's World Cup are just the latest evidence that rape culture is thriving around the world, and knows no cultural bounds.\n\nDylan Martinez / Reuters A fan reacts after the match between Brazil and Mexico on July 2, 2018.\n\nIn addition to these incidents, a bombardment of Twitter posts showcasing sexist and harassing behaviours by Brazilian soccer fans in Russia actually prompted the Brazilian office of UN Women to issue a statement, decrying the \"deliberate intention of some Brazilian fans to sexually harass women during the World Cup.\"\n\nFor me, one silver-lined takeaway in all of this is social media. In many cases it has been a real outlet for targeted women reporters, and a powerful tool for rallying support and rightful indignation, as well as spreading awareness. Because what more can we really do than spread the good word and fight misogynist bullshit wherever and whenever possible?\n\nNSFW: This article was originally published on Bellesa.co\n\nHave you been affected personally by this or another issue?

I only made it 500 yards into Houston when I came across a staging area where ordinary people were conducting water rescues in the Beaumont Place neighbourhood of Houston, TX. In addition to the rescues, residents were able to walk against the current down a long road which is seen in the image. At first I went out on a boat with a couple from Louisiana to help and document several rescues. When we got back, I looked down the road and saw an almost perfect line of residents making the long walk to the staging area. I intentionally moved to a position so I could photograph them in a way that would convey the magnitude of this storm. I wanted to communicate that it was a never-ending line of residents struggling to get to safety and it would go on for days. Harvey was a very difficult and emotionally taxing assignment. My first instinct was to put down the camera and help. It is always hard to come to the realisation that I am most helpful when I am taking pictures.

His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d The cause was suicide, CNN said. Bourdain was in France working on a \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episode when a friend found him unresponsive on Friday morning, CNN reported.\n\nBREAKING: Anthony Bourdain of CNN\u2019s \u201cParts Unknown\u201d is dead. The chef, storyteller and Emmy-winning host has committed suicide at age 61, CNN confirms https://t.co/kUSmSJZXNm pic.twitter.com/VyZyfh5my2 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) June 8, 2018\n\nBourdain, born in New York City in 1956 and raised in New Jersey, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1978, then began a long career in the restaurant industry. He became the executive chef of New York\u2019s Brasserie Les Halles in 1998. By then, he had also turned to writing, chronicling his long hours working in restaurants and his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. A 1999 New Yorker article, \u201cDon\u2019t Eat Before Reading This,\u201d turned into a bestselling book, Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly in 2000. Bourdain continued writing books and essays, and launched several television shows about food and travel, beginning with the Food Network\u2019s \u201cA Cook\u2019s Tour\u201d in 2002. He later hosted the long-running show \u201cNo Reservations\u201d on the Travel Channel, touring the world and highlighting cuisine, culture and politics. The show spawned a spinoff, \u201cThe Layover,\u201d designed for travelers looking for quick getaways. In 2012, Bourdain announced he was leaving the Travel Channel because of concerns his show had become too commercial. He moved to CNN in 2013 to start \u201cParts Unknown.\u201d A 2016 episode about Vietnam featured Bourdain sharing a meal of noodles and beer with then-President Barack Obama.\n\nBourdain was known for his bold, brash style and his penchant for profanity. He is survived by a young daughter, with ex-wife Ottavia Busia. He was previously married to Nancy Putkoski, who he met in high school. At the time of his death, he was in a relationship with Italian actress and director Asia Argento, whom he met while working on a 2016 \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episode about Rome. Argento, among many prominent women who have accused former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of rape, has become an outspoken advocate for the Me Too movement. Bourdain has also been a leading advocate against sexual misconduct, speaking candidly about harassment against women in the restaurant industry. Bourdain and Argento recently worked together on a \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episode on Hong Kong, which she directed. It aired June 3. \u201cAnthony gave all of himself in everything that he did. His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds,\u201d Argento said in a statement Friday. \u201cHe was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\u201d This article has been updated to include Argento\u2019s statement.

			"text": "At one point in cannabis culture history, mastering the art of baking the perfect weed brownie was considered a rite of passage, but those days are long gone.\n\nThanks to the development of medical marijuana programs and the decriminalization and legalization of recreational cannabis in multiple states, the THC-infused world of eats has evolved far beyond brownies, cookies and admittedly impressive dispensary snacks and moved into the culinary space.\n\nCannabis cuisine had been gaining popularity among casual consumers and connoisseurs alike, but now it\u2019s being welcomed into the mainstream as never before.\n\nWhen Martha Stewart gets in on the action, you know it\u2019s gone mainstream.\n\nMedia and entertainment have been pushing the narrative of marijuana normalcy into the homes of more conventional audiences with shows like Vice\u2019s \u201cBong Appetit\u201d and VH1\u2019s \u201cSnoop and Martha\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party.\u201d Chefs around the country are embracing cannabis and elevating the lowly edible to the same sensory realm as high-end cuisine by curating pop-up dinners, supper clubs and private events where cannabis can shine.\n\nCat Cora, the first female \u201cIron Chef\u201d and an advocate for cannabis who recently graced the cover of Cannabis Now Magazine, is speaking out about infusing foods with marijuana.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning a lot about usage, dosage, things like that,\u201d she told the magazine in April. \u201cI\u2019m a big proponent for olive oil. I\u2019m Greek, obviously, but the Mediterranean diet as we know it is the healthiest diet on the planet. So [I\u2019m adding cannabis olive oil to] anything that I can infuse.\u201d\n\nFor example, she said she\u2019s put cannabis olive oil in vinaigrette for salads. \u201cI have so many amazing ideas and a lot of things that I really want to apply it to,\u201d she added. \u201cI want to create products around cannabis with the right partner and the right situation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s gaining respect at the top culinary levels.\n\nThis shift from stoner snacks to foodies and fine dining puts the focus not only on the buzz the plant creates when consumed but on its flavor profile and pairing capabilities, just like any other herb or even wine.\n\nAndrea Drummer is the co-owner of a Los Angeles culinary cannabis events company, Elevation VIP Cooperative. As a classically trained chef, the Cordon Bleu graduate gives cannabis the gourmet treatment in dishes that reveal her ingenuity and creativity. Take, for example, her cannabis-infused bread pudding souffl\u00e9, which she brul\u00e9es, or her Southern take on stuffed grape leaves made instead with collard greens filled with cannabis-infused spicy dirty rice, which she served at a private Spotify dinner event.\n\nDrummer\u2019s skills have earned her a spot on \u201cCooking on High,\u201d the first cannabis cooking competition show that features chefs from around the country. The show debuted on Netflix this month.\n\nWhile that\u2019s exciting, Drummer said she sees even bigger things on the horizon.\n\n\u201cBringing cannabis into the culinary conversation is important because it allows people to open their minds to something they may have been against because they haven\u2019t understood its potential,\u201d she said. \u201cWith more people becoming educated about it, I think cannabis cooking will evolve to the place where we will see things like restaurants and cafes at some point.\u201d\n\nBut the law is keeping cannabis out of restaurants.\n\nFor now, you won\u2019t find restaurants that offer full-service cannabis dining even in states like California or Colorado.\n\nThe reason is legality.\n\nBecause cannabis is still a Schedule I substance under federal law, states that have legalized recreational marijuana are only offering licenses and permits that allow chefs to serve cannabis-infused food in private settings. (Just a reminder to know your local laws.)\n\nTo allow people who don\u2019t live in states where private events are hosted to get a taste of what\u2019s going on, some chefs are passing on their kitchen secrets to home cooks.\n\nOne of them is Coreen Carroll, chef and co-founder of a cannabis-infused pop-up event in San Francisco called the Cannaisseur Series. Her upcoming cookbook, Edibles, is designed to accompany both newbies and virtuosos in what she calls the modern cannabis kitchen.\n\nOthers like Drummer, Laurie Wolf, Jessica Catalano and even Bob Marley\u2019s daughter Cedella Marley are helping people at home learn to incorporate cannabis into their cooking. Their instructional guides not only share recipes but explain the basics of cannabis strains and dosing to help cooks control the type of experience they create with their food.\n\nGadgets can make it easier to cook with cannabis at home.\n\nHome cooks are also being brought into the fold with herbal infusion appliances that take the confusion, legwork and need for constant supervision out of making the perfectly infused product.\n\nCompanies have been introducing countertop devices that make the infusion process as easy as brewing coffee or tea and allow home cooks to flavor a dish with cannabis the same as oregano, rosemary or thyme. With appliances like the LEVO and the MagicalButter, cooks can infuse butter or oil with cannabis by just adding their ingredients and pressing a button.\n\nShanel Lindsay, the founder and president of Ardent, has created a smart device that helps activate the THC in cannabis. The process \u2015 called decarboxylation \u2015 involves heating cannabis up to a certain temperature to release the THC and make it more available for the body to absorb upon consumption.\n\nA stove or toaster oven will also do this, but Lindsay contends her device provides greater precision and temperature control in order to preserve the flavor profile and potency of the cannabis. With the device, cooks can decarboxylate their choice of flower, concentrate or kief in just a little over an hour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a one-button solution to being able to make just about any cannabis-infused product you want,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThe sky is the limit.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for cannabis cuisine in the U.S.\n\nSo what can we look forward to? Amsterdam-style coffee shops with infused goodies on the menu? Cannabis restaurants open to the public? An instructional cooking show on a major network? A culinary cannabis school on par with Le Cordon Bleu? Perhaps.\n\nUntil then, the future of cannabis cuisine rests on the shoulders of the chefs and home cooks whose skill and dedication should continue to strip away the stigma that masks the herb\u2019s versatility.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to offer people a new way of thinking about and approaching cannabis,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cThe industry is very fast-moving and it\u2019s important that mainstream culture reflects this shift in how people are viewing cannabis and all of its possibilities.\u201d\n\nCannabis cuisine awaits the final cutting of the regulatory red tape before it can move into full bloom. But the seeds have definitely been planted."

But that's not how the world works in 2015.\n\nThe Myth of the Ethical Shopper Michael Hobbes\n\nThere\u2019s this video that went viral earlier this year. On Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, a vending machine is selling plain white T-shirts for \u20ac2 each. Customers approach in ones and twos, insert coins, pick a size. Then, before the shirt comes out, a photo appears\u2014a black-and-white image of rows of sewing machines. \u201cMeet Manisha,\u201d the screen reads, dissolving to a close-up of a girl in a headscarf who looks about 16. She earns \u201cas little as 13 cents an hour each day for 16 hours.\u201d The Berliners put their hands over their mouths. \u201cDo you still want to buy this shirt?\u201d the display asks. The menu comes up again. This time, the options are \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cdonate.\u201d As the music swells, all the shoppers press \u201cdonate.\u201d For a generation now, buying better has been one of our most potent forms of protest. Who doesn\u2019t want to believe that he can rescue Manisha from misery simply by purchasing the right T-shirt? The same idea underpins hundreds of earnest NGO advocacy campaigns urging people to take action against the Swooshtika, Badidas, Killer Coke. It prompted a much-praised John Oliver expos\u00e9 in which he blasts H&M for selling \u201csuspiciously cheap\u201d clothes sourced in Bangladesh. The only trouble is, this narrative is bullshit. It all started in the mid-\u201990s, when anti-sweatshop mania burst into the mainstream of American culture. Naked people chanted outside the opening of an Old Navy, Jennifer Love Hewitt led an anti-sweatshop protest on \"Party of Five,\" Kathie Lee Gifford cried in front of Congress. Nearly every major apparel brand was, at one point or another, the target of a boycott campaign. Radiohead told its millions of fans to read No Logo, Naomi Klein\u2019s investigative polemic against multinational corporations. And for a while there, it worked. The major apparel companies adopted codes of conduct, first banning just the most egregious stuff\u2014workers under 16, forced overtime\u2014then expanding to health and safety, environmental protection and social investment. Since 1998, Nike has followed U.S. clean air standards in all of its factories worldwide, while Levi\u2019s gives financial literacy classes to some of its seamstresses. Every company from Hanes to Halliburton has a social responsibility report. An entire ecosystem of independent inspectors and corporate consultants has sprung up, applying auditing standards that are as pedantic and uncompromising as the NGOs advocating for them. But in the past 25 years, the apparel industry, the entire global economy, has undergone a complete transformation. The way our clothes are made and distributed and thrown away is barely recognizable compared to the way it was done in the \u201990s. And yet our playbook for improving it remains exactly the same. This year, I spoke with more than 30 company reps, factory auditors and researchers and read dozens of studies describing what has happened in those sweatshops since they became a cultural fixation three decades ago. All these sources led me to the same conclusion: Boycotts have failed. Our clothes are being made in ways that advocacy campaigns can\u2019t affect and in places they can\u2019t reach. So how are we going to stop sweatshops now?\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax1_caption\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to a corporate social responsibility conference, you\u2019ve undoubtedly heard the story of the three fire extinguishers. The way it goes is, an inspector was walking through a clothing factory in Bangladesh and noticed that it had three fire extinguishers on the wall, one right on top of the other. He asked why, and the manager of the factory told him, \u201cWe get audited under three different standards, and they each require us to have a fire extinguisher a different distance from the floor. We got tired of moving the fire extinguisher every time an inspector came, so now we just have one at each height.\u201d This is the world that No Logo built. By the end of the \u201990s, a society-wide consensus had formed on how companies should operate their developing-country factories. First, we wanted them to ban all the terrible things we read about in magazines. No more child labor, choked ventilation, abusive bosses, confiscated passports. Companies should apply U.S. working conditions or, at the minimum, follow local laws where they operated. Second, we wanted them to send inspectors to see if those commitments were being met. And most companies did these things. That was the easy part. The hard part, it turned out, is that these structures aren\u2019t designed to make factories take better care of their workers. They\u2019re designed to make factories look like they are. When you hear the word \u201cinspector,\u201d you think of a sort of detective, walking up and down whirring assembly lines, interviewing workers, interrogating managers. In reality, factory audits are primarily a paperwork exercise. Inspectors typically spend one day\u2014two, tops\u2014at each factory, mostly in the back office, checking time sheets for shift lengths, birth certificates for child labor, pay stubs for wages and overtime. In a 2009 survey, Chinese auditors referred to their work as a \u201ccat-and-mouse game.\u201d They updated their inspections to get around the fraud: asking workers their zodiac signs instead of their birthdays, checking for wrinkles on birth certificates. Then the factories updated their fraud to get around the inspections. Auditors tell me of arriving at factories where the owners play a song over the loudspeakers as a signal to shuffle the child laborers out the back. \u201cSometimes [employees] answer before you ask the question,\u201d says Rachelle Jackson, director of sustainability and innovation at Arche Advisors, who estimates she\u2019s done around 1,500 audits. \u201cYou ask, \u2018What time do you start work?\u2019 and they say, \u2018Eight hours.\u2019\u201d Those small-batch, hemp-woven Daisy Dukes you bought in Dumbo are far more likely to be made in a sweatshop than your $7 H&M gym shorts. For his book The Promise and Limits of Private Power, Brown University\u2019s Richard Locke examined 10 years of Nike inspections. Nike was doing two kinds of audits, one mostly based on paperwork and the other incorporating the impressions of its staff after visiting factories. From 2001 to 2005, the paperwork audit showed that working conditions in almost all of Nike\u2019s suppliers were steadily improving. When Locke checked the qualitative audit, though, he found that nearly 80 percent of them either hadn\u2019t improved\u2014or had gotten worse. Partly in response to this dynamic, a lot of the big brands switched tactics, moving from wrist-slapping to worker-training. In 2009, Nike set up a model factory in Sri Lanka and sent managers there from all over the world. Since any change in operations can make suppliers less productive at first, the company signed long-term agreements with factories, pledging to stick with them as they learned how to meet deadlines using better methods and safer equipment rather than longer shifts. But these second-gen practices couldn\u2019t insulate factories from the countries where they operated. The Nike training worked wonders in Mexico, but had no effect in China or Sri Lanka. Between 8 and 10 percent of Mexican workers quit every year. In China, it was that high per month: They were training employees only to send them to other firms. Mexican factories had unions and NGOs telling workers how to take employers to court if they didn\u2019t pay back wages. In China, where labor activism is basically illegal, workers didn\u2019t even know which rights they had, let alone how to exercise them. Nike is Vietnam's biggest employer. In 1996, 12 workers in a Nike factory were hospitalized after their manager made them run around in circles for not wearing the right shoes. The incident sparked worldwide protests. (Photo credit: Steve Raymer/Corbis) Now, I don\u2019t want to give the impression that consumer boycotts were totally useless. Twenty-five years after the movement began, some large suppliers have formalized workforces, provide better health and safety practices and pay above the minimum wage. Ironically, it\u2019s the major brands, the companies that are still the targets of those viral NGO campaigns, which are the most likely to use these factories. The biggest names, after all, have the greatest incentive (and the resources) to defend their reputations. Chikako Oka, a lecturer at Royal Holloway University, found that reputation-conscious companies had 35 percent fewer working violations in their Cambodian factories than did generic brands. Which leads us to the first flaw with our existing model of anti-sweatshop advocacy. It\u2019s not the largest or the second-largest company we should be worried about anymore. It\u2019s the 44th, or the 207th. Those small-batch, hemp-woven Daisy Dukes you bought in Dumbo are far more likely to be made in a sweatshop than your $7 H&M gym shorts. But that\u2019s not the only problem. In the last 25 years, as the big brands were getting (somewhat) better at monitoring their supply chains, the entire global apparatus of manufacturing shifted underneath them.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax2_caption\n\nAt 6:45 p.m. on November 24, 2012, the fire alarm went off on the fourth floor of a nondescript building in the suburbs of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Inside, nearly 1,200 garment workers were on deadline, scrambling to complete an order. When the bells started ringing, they asked if they could leave. Their managers told them to go back to their machines. Five minutes later, the floor filled with black smoke; screams could be heard from below. The building had no sprinklers or fire escapes. Workers tried to flee down an internal staircase, but the exits were locked. Those on the lower floors were trapped by boxes of yarn and clothes that had already been completed. The fire eventually engulfed the building, killing at least 112 people and injuring hundreds more. Some broke their backs and legs jumping from the windows. Most of the workers inside the Tazreen garment factory were making clothing for Western brands: Dickies, Wal-Mart, Disney, all their logos showed up on labels pulled from the rubble. But Tazreen wasn\u2019t yet another example of corporations failing to police conditions in their factories. It was an example of how doing so has become impossible. Inside the Tazreen garment factory after the fire. (Photo credit: Reuters/Corbis) We buy more clothes now, move through trends faster. In the olden days\u2014the early \u201890s\u2014brands produced two to four fashion cycles per year, big orders coordinated by season, planned months in advance. These days, there\u2019s no such thing as cycles, only products. If a shirt is selling well, Wal-Mart orders its suppliers to make more. If headbands inexplicably come into fashion, H&M rushes to make millions of them before they go out again. This flexibility means that factories have to compete on the number of clothing lines they can produce and how quickly they can switch from one to another. Chinese manufacturers that once made four products at a time now make 300. Locke profiles a Honduran supplier that used to have around two months to prepare orders for Western brands\u2014buy fabric, cut T-shirt shapes out of it, sew them together, send them to stores. Now they get one week. In the fast-fashion era, Western brands can\u2019t afford the luxury of working with the same suppliers and ensuring that they meet the company\u2019s standards. And so, rather than manage a giant, respirating network of factories themselves, most of them have outsourced this coordination to megasuppliers: huge conglomerates that can take a design sketch, split the production between thousands of factories, box up the goods and ship them to stores in less time than they\u2019ll stay in style. Manufacturing middlemen aren\u2019t new, of course: Those \u201cNike factories\u201d in Indonesia that Jennifer Love Hewitt marched against were actually run by Taiwanese and Korean firms. What is new, though, is how big the megasuppliers have become and how much of the sector they control. In Sri Lanka, four companies generate roughly 25 percent of the country\u2019s garment income. Yue Yuen, the Foxconn of footwear, makes one-fifth of all the shoes in the world. The largest apparel megasupplier, Li & Fung, which produces everything from Wal-Mart basics to Disney plush toys to Spanx, has revenues of $19.2 billion; more than Ralph Lauren, Armani and Tommy Hilfiger combined. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport calls Li & Fung\u2019s operations \u201cephemeral.\u201d It has 15,000 supplier factories in 40 countries, but doesn\u2019t own or operate any of them. It\u2019s a coordinator, configuring cotton suppliers, textile mills, stitching and sewing houses into a straight line just long enough to deliver one order to one buyer, and then reconfiguring them for the next. Li & Fung does inspect its suppliers and send reports back to its buyers. But there\u2019s no guarantee that orders will be filled by the same factory twice, and audits are often carried out after the order has already been placed. And so clothing companies have no ability or incentive to fix what they find. It's like finding out the results of a restaurant health inspection after you've already eaten your meal. In 2013, The New York Times published a sort of greatest-hits of Li & Fung violations: 29 workers killed in a fire in Bangladesh in 2010; at least two workers killed in a \u201cstampede,\u201d also in Bangladesh, in 2011; 280 workers fainting at a facility in Cambodia due to malnourishment and air contamination; a dozen workers fired in Indonesia, allegedly for trying to start a union. Jeroen Merk, a researcher at the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus University Rotterdam\u2014and one of the few academics who\u2019s investigating the megasuppliers\u2014says their business model is deliberately organized to keep buyers separated from factories. If brands discover what factories charge, they might work with them directly and keep the margin for themselves. Some companies ordering clothes through megasuppliers, he says, don\u2019t know which factories they were made in\u2014or even which countries. In many cases, the megasuppliers don\u2019t know either. Last year, a compliance manager for a European brand told NYU\u2019s Center for Business and Human Rights that small factories in Bangladesh, capable of producing just 10,000 pieces per month, were accepting orders 10 times that large and then filling them through agents, small workshops, and home-based workers. Gale Raj-Reichert, a researcher at the University of Manchester who studies electronics supply chains, met a manufacturer in Malaysia who had no idea which company he was producing for. He got his orders and delivered his goods exclusively through middlemen. After the Tazreen fire, NGO campaigns focused on how Wal-Mart was responsible for 60 percent of the clothing being produced there. But Wal-Mart never actually placed an order with Tazreen. In fact, over a year before the fire, Wal-Mart inspected the factory and discovered that it was unsafe. By the time of the fire, it had banned its suppliers from using it. So here\u2019s how its products ended up at Tazreen anyway: Wal-Mart hired a megasupplier called Success Apparel to fill an order for shorts. Success hired another company, Simco, to carry out the work. Simco\u2014without telling Success, much less Wal-Mart\u2014sub-contracted 7 percent of the order to Tazreen\u2019s parent company, the Tuba Group, which then assigned it to Tazreen. Two other sub- (or sub-sub-sub-) contractors also placed Wal-Mart orders at Tazreen, also without telling the company. It was the same with many of the other brands whose labels were found in Tazreen: They either didn\u2019t know their clothes were being produced there or had explicitly banned the factory as a supplier. Those companies now say that, because the orders violated their policies, they\u2019re not obligated to compensate victims. It\u2019s tempting to think that we can do something about this. Boycott the companies that use megasuppliers, maybe. Last year, partly over concerns about sub-contracting, Wal-Mart \u201cin-sourced\u201d its production back from Li & Fung and started coordinating its own network of suppliers. But the Wal-Marts of the world can\u2019t magically un-link themselves from the pressures of global supply and demand. Instead, companies that in-source production just become their own megasuppliers. Subcontractors can still deceive auditors or farm out orders without telling Wal-Mart. For smaller companies, the ones NGOs aren\u2019t watching, in-sourcing isn\u2019t even an option. And besides, going after the megasuppliers just moves the tired name-and-shame routine one layer down. Auditors tell me Li & Fung, just like the companies it sells to, has good factories and bad ones. As it grows, it is finding reasons to defend its public reputation\u2014it is still the only company that has directly paid compensation to the victims of Tazreen. The worst conditions probably aren\u2019t in Li & Fung factories, but in the ones a few billion in revenue down the rankings. In Cambodia, a group of South Korean intermediaries, all of them with names you\u2019ve never heard, are backing a lawsuit against their own workers, demanding that they pay back $200 million in revenue the companies lost during a strike. Consumers\u2019 power, to the extent we had any, depended on brands forcing their supply chains to do better. Now they\u2014and we\u2014are losing that power. And that\u2019s still not the worst of it. The really atrocious violations, the ones most likely to proliferate, are in places where we have no influence at all.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax3_caption\n\nIn Delhi\u2019s garment cluster, \u201cchildren start learning the job at the age of 8,\u201d writes the University of London\u2019s Alessandra Mezzadri. \u201cThey master it by the age of 12.\u201d She calls the area a \u201ccomposite sweatshop\u201d: For every tailor working in a factory, there are several employed in homes, workshops or backyards. Around 80 percent of the workers are informal \u2014 mostly migrants, some of them trafficked, hired and fired as orders are commissioned and completed, divvied out by brokers, paid a few cents for each piece of clothing they deliver. The children get paid half as much as the adults. During her fieldwork, she found kids sitting on apartment floors, sewing and cutting, often under the supervision of their parents. Vignettes like these are usually invoked to condemn us for our own complicity in these wages, these workshops. Delhi\u2019s garment workers aren\u2019t producing clothes for export, though. They\u2019re sewing saris and embroidering clothes destined for Indian and Bangladeshi and Pakistani shelves, not Western ones. This, Mezzadri told me, is \u201cwhy child labor persists.\u201d Factories in developing countries that send clothes to export markets need to at least look like they\u2019re complying with social standards. For domestic markets, they don\u2019t. Maybe even more than the other reasons I\u2019ve outlined, this is why consumer advocacy campaigns are never going to improve working conditions in the developing world: Western markets simply don\u2019t matter as much as they used to. India produces twice as much clothing for its own consumers as it does for us. Fifty-six percent of the clothing produced in China is for the Chinese market. Both of those numbers are only going to grow. And it\u2019s not just developing countries selling stuff to themselves. They\u2019re also selling a rapidly expanding share to each other. From 2008 to 2013, the fastest-growing demand for apparel was in China, Eastern Europe, India, Turkey and Brazil. Garment exports from Bangladesh to other poor countries have grown by as much as 50 percent per year. Rich countries make up just one-tenth of the world\u2019s population. In the next 15 years, their share of consumption is expected to fall from 64 percent to 30 percent. Most of the 1.2 billion people the global economy added to the middle class in the last 15 years earn between $2 and $13 per day. \u201cThe nature of demand will be for cheap, undifferentiated goods,\u201d says a World Bank report\u2014exactly the kinds of products that are most likely to be made in supply chains with low or nonexistent labor standards. This shift is already eroding the meager gains we\u2019ve made protecting labor conditions and the environment in poor countries. The timber sector in Gabon, for example, used to specialize in high-quality, processed lumber for European customers. Exporting to OECD countries meant that all the wood had to comply with local labor laws and Forestry Code guidelines on sustainability and biodiversity. By 2007, however, the sector was selling 80 percent of its timber to China and India. Exporters shifted to selling unprocessed logs, which generate less profit and create one-quarter as many jobs as plywood. Since they now compete on quantity, rather than quality, they cut down three times as many trees to make the same revenue. Their new buyers don\u2019t require environmental and labor certifications, so they\u2019ve fallen away. It\u2019s the same in Burma. In the two years after its military dictatorship uncorked in 2011, $40 billion in foreign investment poured in. Most of it came from Chinese, Malaysian, Singaporean and Thai companies; as of 2013, the United States was only the ninth largest investor. The results are about what you would expect. Earlier this year, more than 2,000 Burmese workers marched in protest outside a factory producing for E-Land, the South Korean-owned conglomerate that is now the largest women\u2019s-apparel retailer in China. The workers were demanding a raise from $1 per day. The factory was in a special economic zone; the workers were arrested on the pretext that they didn\u2019t have a permit for the demonstration. This February, Burmese workers went on strike against Tai Yee, a Chinese-owned footwear factory. (Photo credit: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP) Asian companies investing in Burma aren\u2019t run by worse or greedier people than ours are. They\u2019re just operating under a different risk calculus. American firms putting more than $500,000 into the country are required to publicly report their land acquisitions, payments to local officials, and security arrangements. If they get busted doing something heinous, they\u2019ll end up on front pages. Developing-country multinationals don\u2019t have these pressures. The standard response here is that, as Chinese consumers get richer, they, too, will start demanding pesticide-free apples, cruelty-free jeans, dolphin-free tuna. And indeed, China has passed tons of legislation the past few years to improve working conditions and even requires reporting by its companies abroad. But pointing to these small (and un-enforced) steps ignores other countries that have climbed up the income ladder and haven\u2019t brought social concerns with them. There have been no major consumer movements in Hong Kong against Li & Fung. South Korea has the same per capita GDP as New Zealand, but has shown no interest in regulating its companies abroad. Khalid Nadvi, a professor at the University of Manchester, says there have been no cases of Chinese consumers agitating over foreign working conditions. \u201cThe emerging middle class in China is first and second generation,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of them worked in the kinds of factories we\u2019re advocating to improve.\u201d As more and more of the world\u2019s economy takes place without us, we need to change the way we think about going after sweatshops. There\u2019s only one idea I\u2019ve heard that has the potential to address the flawed audits, the opaque megasuppliers and the changes in global consumption all at once.\n\ntranslation missing: en.parallax4_caption\n\nNot so long ago, the laborers in Brazil who made pig-iron, an essential ingredient in stainless steel, lived in hopelessly grim conditions. They would set up in a clearing in the Amazonian rainforest, burn the trees to charcoal, sell it to smelters, then move to another clearing and start over. They tended 1000-degree furnaces barefoot, earning wages just low enough to keep them trapped in a cycle of debt to their employer or a labor broker. The furnaces were small-scale, informal, everywhere. A Brazilian labor inspector told a researcher in 2004, \u201cI saw cattle living in better conditions than the workers.\u201d Penalizing the furnaces wasn\u2019t an option: Brazil produced millions of tons of pig iron every year like this. Busting a single operator, or even dozens, would only add fines to the cost of doing business. Instead, the inspectors got creative. Working with public prosecutors, they unearthed an obscure judicial statement that prohibited companies from outsourcing their \u201ccore\u201d activities. They told the smelters, the ones buying the charcoal, that from now on it was their responsibility to make sure furnaces weren\u2019t employing forced labor. Inspectors went up the chain too, convincing the country\u2019s largest iron-ore company to sell only to smelters that could prove their charcoal came from replanted forests and not illegal first-growth timber. They worked with state-run banks to cut off smelters from subsidized credit for two years if they didn\u2019t closely monitor their suppliers. Suddenly, the smelters were responsible for ensuring that their raw material was produced under decent conditions. They founded an industry-wide auditing body and started sending quality experts and auditors out in pickups to check on the furnaces. By 2009, the percentage of charcoal made from illegal timber had dropped from 60 percent to 30 percent. Workers were signing contracts and earning higher wages. Furnaces were cooperating with smelters to produce higher-grade iron. All of this, it should be obvious by now, would have been impossible for private auditors. Most of that pig-iron was being bought by foreign car companies. Sure, they could have done more inspections, delivered some training, or threatened to pull orders. But encouraging smelters to move into higher-grade, more profitable exports would have been directly against the car companies\u2019 interests. Yet this is how we expect to bring about better labor conditions in poor countries. Instead of empowering domestic agencies with a mandate to prevent abuses, we rely on international corporations seeking to insulate themselves from bad publicity. Nearly all of the horror stories that show up in consumer campaigns are illegal in the countries where they take place. These countries simply don\u2019t have anyone to enforce the laws. Bangladesh has just 125 labor inspectors for 75 million workers. Cambodian inspectors, on average, earn less than half as much as the garment workers whose conditions they\u2019re supposed to be safeguarding. Uganda, with 40 million people, has only 120 practitioners capable of carrying out environmental impact assessments. In Burma, regional governments have received more than 6,000 complaints related to land revocations, but have investigated fewer than 300 of them. That\u2019s why Brazil is so startling. It has 10,000 public prosecutors and 3,000 inspectors, all making monthly salaries of at least $5,000. The inspectors collaborate with other government agencies, workers, unions and NGOs, not just to find the most outrageous violations, but to actually fix them. NYU\u2019s Salo Coslovsky, from whom I stole the pig-iron example, says Brazilian inspectors act more like McKinsey consultants than cops. Just as schoolteachers don\u2019t enforce every rule every time it\u2019s broken, he says, inspectors are allowed to overlook minor transgressions (making workers stay late to get an order completed) to solve bigger ones (outdated machinery, dangerous buildings, systematic discrimination). When inspectors wanted to reduce child labor, they convened parents, schools, and farms, created maps of the areas where the worst abuses were likely to happen, and dispatched vans full of auditors to prevent them. When public prosecutors wanted to keep shrimp farms from polluting the shore, they worked with three separate government agencies to relocate farmers away from riverbanks. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of regulatory acupuncture,\u201d says Roberto Pires, a researcher at the Institute for Applied Economic Research, a think tank in Bras\u00edlia, \u201cfinding the specific points where applying pressure can provoke systemic effects.\u201d In another case, inspectors found that auto-parts manufacturers were using outdated metal-stamping machines. Those factories were responsible for almost half the country\u2019s industrial accidents, including hand, arm and finger amputations. Inspectors couldn\u2019t make factory owners buy new machines\u2014that would have cost millions of dollars. So they worked with a health and safety think tank, as well as state banks, to retrofit the existing machines. Two years later, accidents across the industry had fallen by 66 percent. All this discretion and autonomy, these cowboy inspectors roaming the countryside, sounds like an invitation for corruption. But everyone I speak with says it\u2019s far less of a problem than you\u2019d think. That\u2019s in part because the inspectors are required to do far more than just complete a certain number of investigations per month. Instead, they write qualitative summaries of which worksites they\u2019ve visited, what problems they\u2019ve found and what they\u2019re doing to address them. Listening to consumer advocacy campaigns, you\u2019d think our only influence on the developing world is at the cash register. This process wasn\u2019t easy in Brazil, and it won\u2019t be anywhere else. Brazil\u2019s inspectorate spent more than 30 years justifying its existence. Its farms and factories are not nice places to work in by any absolute definition of the term, and will not be for a long time. The corruption and inefficiency of developing country governments can\u2019t be solved simply with more employees. But going around these governments won\u2019t solve any problems either. One theory on why last year\u2019s Ebola outbreak was so bad is that local hospitals, after years of being bypassed by international NGOs, didn't have the training or equipment they needed to treat their own communities. For decades, we\u2019ve been doing the same thing with factories. In the \u201990s, while we were telling Western companies to audit their suppliers, the World Bank was telling them that government inspectors didn\u2019t need to anymore. Listening to consumer advocacy campaigns, you\u2019d think our only influence on the developing world was at the cash register. But our real leverage is with our policies, not our purchases. In the '90s, the U.S. told Cambodia that to sell its clothes here, it had to open up every single garment factory to International Labor Organization inspections. Trade agreements require developing countries to establish huge intellectual-property inspection bodies to raid markets for bootleg Blu-rays. We just need to offer poor workers the same kinds of protection we give pharmaceutical patents. As for Western companies, we shouldn\u2019t let them off the hook. But let\u2019s be clear: All of those emerging-market multinationals that South Korea and China are sending abroad have operations in the United States, too. Foxconn has a factory in Indiana. It is not a sweatshop. That isn\u2019t because Foxconn carries out such great audits or offers entrepreneurship classes. It\u2019s because it is located in a country with functioning institutions. We are not going to shop ourselves into a better world. Advocating for boring stuff like complaint mechanisms and formalized labor contracts is nowhere near as satisfying as buying a pair of Fair Trade sandals or whatever. But that\u2019s how the hard work of development actually gets done: Not by imploring people to buy better, but by giving them no other option. After all, that naked protest of Old Navy in the '90s? Behind the 50 demonstrators, a line of 300 customers stretched\n\naround the block."

Then we play, and after that I sneak away to practice, usually around 8 a.m. The only rule I have at practice is to be done at 1 p.m., because as much as I love tennis, I need to be with her,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI want to put her above everything else I\u2019m doing, so I take calls when she naps. I usually bathe her every night,\u201d the tennis superstar said. \u201cShe\u2019s in bed by 7:30 at the latest.\u201d Williams told InStyle that she\u2019s only ever been away from her daughter for one day since her birth.

The cover, which was shot by famed fashion photographer Steven Klein and also included male model Justin Martin, came under fire for its extremely bronzed depiction of Hadid. Some outlets and commenters likened the cover to \u201cblackface\u201d and decried what appeared to be a liberal use of photo manipulation on Hadid\u2019s face. Conde Nast International issued a statement about the backlash to the cover on Thursday. \u201cThroughout its history, Vogue Italia has respected and encouraged the creative viewpoints of commissioned photographers. In our latest cover shoot by Steven Klein, the vision was to create a beachwear-themed story with a stylized bronzing effect,\u201d the statement, shared by Teen Vogue, said. \u201cWe understand that the result has caused some debate with our readers, and we sincerely apologize if we have caused any offence.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Steven Klein (@stevenkleinstudio) on May 2, 2018 at 4:40pm PDT\n\nHadid also issued an apology on Thursday and provided a picture that she said showed \u201cthe level I had been bronzed to on set that day.\u201d The model insisted she had no control over the shoot but wanted \u201cto address this for those who were offended by the editing/retouching/coloring of the cover.\u201d \u201cPlease understand that my control of a shoot 1. is non existent in terms of creative direction 2. ends completely when I leave set, and anything done to a photo in post is out of my control fully,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bronzing and photoshop is a style that S. Klein has done for many years and I believe was what was expected from the shoot (to show me in a different way creatively), BUT, although I understand what Vogue Italia\u2019s intentions were, it was not executed correctly, and the concerns that have been brought up are valid.\u201d\n\nHadid apologized for the misstep and added that she hoped the mistake could be used as a \u201clesson\u201d for those in the fashion industry. \u201cI want to apologize because my intention is never to diminish those concerns or take opportunities away from anyone else, and I hope this can be an example to other magazines and teams in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are real issues regarding representation in fashion \u2015 it\u2019s our responsibility to acknowledge those issues and communicate through them to work towards a more diverse industry.\u201d The 23-year-old also removed the picture of the cover from her Instagram page, which she\u2019d previously captioned \u201cExcited, honored, and grateful to cover @VogueItalia\u2019s May Issue. Thank you so so much for an amazing shoot, I am forever inspired by you all !!! & can\u2019t wait to share the full story !!\u201d The photo is still up on Klein\u2019s Instagram page as well as Vogue Italia\u2019s. Comments on the two Instagram pages are riddled with criticisms of Photoshop use and \u201cblackface.\u201d \u201cYou need to stop \u2018bronzing\u2019 these models to make them look like they have a different skin color! Why not just use models who have darker skin tones or just use any model but don\u2019t frickin\u2019 photoshop them to make them look a different race,\u201d one commenter wrote on Klein\u2019s page. Another added, \u201cFor the time you\u2019ve been on Earth, I thought you\u2019d knew the effects of blackface and racism, but I guess we\u2019re gonna have to walk you through it once more, huh?\u201d The commenters on Vogue Italia\u2019s page were just as outraged. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gigi,\u201d one person wrote, while another said, \u201cNo if they wanted a darker woman or of a different ethnicity, then they should do that not photoshop and bronze the fuck out of her.\u201d Hadid came under fire for a Vogue Italia cover once before in 2015, when a very-bronzed Gigi was photographed wearing a variety of colorful Afros.\n\nA post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Nov 6, 2015 at 8:33am PST"

Five minutes in and you're overwhelmed with sleepiness, so much so that the space under your desk is looking pretty damn comfy right about now.\n\nBut why do we get sleepy after lunch? Is it just because we're full, or is it a sign we're not doing lunch right?\n\n\"Feeling a little tired after eating a meal is perfectly normal,\" Robbie Clark, dietitian and sports nutritionist, told The Huffington Post Australia. \"There are a few reasons why we experience the post-lunch slump, but the main reason is due to the digestive process.\"\n\nAlthough it might not feel like it, the body uses a fair amount of energy to digest the pasta you've just eaten.\n\n\"Our body requires energy to function and survive. We get this energy from our food, which is broken down through the digestive process and converted into fuel, or glucose, and then macronutrients provide calories (or energy) to our bodies. Our digestive system triggers all kinds of responses within our body,\" Clark explained.\n\nGetty\n\nAnother reason we may feel sleepy after lunch, or after eating in general, is due to the amount of insulin produced after certain meals, which can trigger our 'happy' and 'sleep' hormones.\n\n\"After eating -- particularly sugary foods -- insulin is produced by the pancreas which then converts these sugars (glucose), circulating in the bloodstream into glycogen within our cells,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Excessive secretion of insulin causes the essential amino acid tryptophan to move into the brain. Once in the brain, it leads to increased production of serotonin and melatonin, which are two neurotransmitters that have a calming effect and help regulate sleep. Interestingly, around 90 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal movements.\"\n\nAccredited practising dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon agrees, saying the amount of carbohydrates we eat at lunch can affect how sleepy we feel afterward.\n\n\"Carbohydrate containing foods such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes boost the production of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin, which can boost our mood but also make us feel content and possibly sleepy,\" O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia.\n\ndiffused Cheese, turkey and bread can all make us feel a little sleepy.\n\n\"It's often when we've eaten quite a large meal that we may feel uncomfortable and sluggish, as well, so it's always good to listen to our hunger signals and stop when we feel comfortably satisfied.\"\n\nAnother factor that may contribute to drowsiness after a meal is if you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance.\n\n\"Food allergies and intolerances are usually associated with digestive problems such as bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea, as well as lethargy,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Finally, general overeating, large portions and the consumption of particularly fatty meals can leave you feeling sleepy because the body has to work overtime and utilise more energy to break down the quantity of food.\"\n\nOn top of these physiological reasons as to why we may feel sleepy after lunch, there are also a few other key foods which can contribute.\n\nJGI/Jamie Grill The feeling when your lunch order has arrived.\n\n\"Though all foods are digested in much the same way, not all foods affect your body in the same way,\" Clark explained.\n\n\"For example, you've probably heard or experienced that turkey can make you sleepier than other foods. Turkey and other high protein foods such as spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu and fish contain higher levels of tryptophan. Studies have shown that cherries (particularly sour cherry) affects melatonin levels, which is the hormone responsible for inducing sleep.\"\n\nAnother sleepiness inducing food is white bread, particularly when compared to whole grain, wholemeal or multigrain bread.\n\n\"When you consume white bread your body quickly absorbs the fibre-less starches and refined sugars rapidly, which causes a spike your blood glucose levels. This spike is short lived and results in plummeting blood glucose levels, which can lead to feelings of tiredness and sleepiness,\" Clark said.\n\nTo avoid after lunch sleepiness, Clark and O'Hanlon recommend the following.\n\nGetty Images The feeling when you've finished said lunch.\n\n1. Don't skip breakfast\n\nWe've all been told how important breakfast is for both our bodies and mind. According to Clark, eating breakfast can also help reduce tiredness later in the day.\n\n\"If you skip breakfast, it sets the energy standard for the rest of the day,\" Clark said. \"Plus, come lunch time you will be extremely hungry and are more likely to make poorer food choices or have a larger portion.\"\n\n2. Eat smaller meals throughout the day\n\n\"A large meal requires more energy to digest. Instead of eating large lunches, you may want to try eating smaller meals throughout the day,\" Clark said.\n\n\"For example, balance a small lunch with mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks so that you meet your recommended dietary intake of calories throughout the day.\"\n\n\"Eating smaller, more frequent meals across the day can help keep our blood sugar levels steady and give us those regular top ups of energy,\" O'Hanlon added.\n\n\"It's never good to overdo it at any meal, and getting the balance of carbohydrates, proteins and good fats can help fuel us for longer.\"\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Don't forget to fill up on brekkie.\n\n3. Opt for macro-nutrient balanced meals\n\n\"Instead of choosing processed foods and starchy sides, make sure that your lunch is balanced and healthy by opting to have a lunch that features colourful vegetables as the main attraction, and a serving of whole grains and lean protein,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Other food tips to avoid slumped energy levels include drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated, avoiding too much sugar and refined carbohydrates, and eating smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n\"Also, to help balance blood sugar and insulin levels, choose natural foods that are high in fibre and protein such as whole grains, legumes and nuts.\"\n\nTo know how to choose (or make) macro-nutrient balanced meals, O'Hanlon recommends focusing on the healthy plate model.\n\n\"Aim for half your plate to be non-starchy veggies, one quarter to be lean meat or alternatives, and one quarter to be whole grains,\" she said.\n\n\"Often we tend to skimp on the vegetable or salad component, but it's important to get a few serves of our 'five a day' at lunch time and this will help balance the rest of our plate.\"\n\nMartin Poole Stir fry with brown rice is a winning combo of carbs, fat and protein.\n\n4. Go outside or get moving\n\nInstead of spending your lunch time inside, enjoy your meal outside and, if you can, schedule in a walk.\n\n\"Exercise can keep you alert during the day by optimising oxygen and blood circulation around the body and to the brain, minimising the risk of your post-meal slump,\" Clark said.\n\n\"Getting outdoors is also going to help increase oxygenation to the brain.\"\n\n5. Check in with the doctor\n\nIf you're constantly feeling tired and it's affecting your day-to-day life, O'Hanlon recommends checking in with a health professional.\n\n\"If you're feeling tired it could be also due to a vitamin or mineral deficiency. For example, iron deficiency, which is very common in young females, particular those not eating meat,\" O'Hanlon said.\n\n\"If you're feeling tired regularly, I'd recommend visiting your local GP and having a general check-up.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on 01/09/2016.\n\nFollow us on Snapchat!\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST AUSTRALIA"

Sin embargo, Pedroche ha desmentido este mi\u00e9rcoles que est\u00e9 embarazada a trav\u00e9s de un v\u00eddeo que ha colgado en su cuenta de Instagram.\n\n\"Muchos me han preguntado que por qu\u00e9 no he hecho v\u00eddeos antes de Zapeando. Porque me dol\u00eda mucho la tripa y no por lo que muchos est\u00e1is pensando\", ha comenzado la presentadora, que ha publicado en el v\u00eddeo las noticias de su posible embarazo. Adem\u00e1s, Pedroche ha explicado que su familia y amigos le han llamado para preguntarle si era cierto.\n\nPedroche ha hablado tambi\u00e9n sobre una de sus \u00faltimas publicaciones, un v\u00eddeo en el que daba de comer al hijo de una amiga, para explicar la presi\u00f3n que sienten las mujeres de su edad por ser o no madre: \"La presi\u00f3n siempre acaba en la mujer. Una mujer es una solterona y un hombre un soltero de oro\". La reportera ha a\u00f1adido que toda esta historia del embarazo ha estado motivada porque le vieron entrar en el ginec\u00f3logo. \"Hay que ir al ginec\u00f3logo m\u00ednimo una vez al a\u00f1o. No, no estoy embarazada, lo siento\", ha sentenciado.\n\nLa historia surgi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que Kiko Hern\u00e1ndez contase en S\u00e1lvame que una fuente an\u00f3nima hab\u00eda visto a Mu\u00f1oz y Pedroche salir juntos de una cl\u00ednica del Ensanche de Vallecas, donde se realizan ecograf\u00edas y controles de embarazo.\n\nJusto un mes antes la presentadora confes\u00f3 en su cuenta de Instagram que no quer\u00eda ser madre por el momento, \"ni quiz\u00e1s tampoco en el futuro\". Con estas declaraciones, Pedroche respond\u00eda a las cr\u00edticas de sus seguidores que la criticaban por no tener a\u00fan hijos. \"De verdad, dejemos que cada mujer haga lo que quiera con su vida y no presionemos. La maternidad es una opci\u00f3n que cada mujer debe poder elegir libremente\", a\u00f1adi\u00f3.\n\nGTRES La pareja en 'El Hormiguero' de Antena 3.\n\nLa pareja se cas\u00f3 en 2015 en su domicilio, de sorpresa y ante notario, sin ning\u00fan tipo de celebraci\u00f3n. De hecho, la presentadora protagoniz\u00f3 un enlace \"en zapatillas y vaqueros\". La presentadora de Zapeando y chef de DiverXO llevan juntos desde diciembre de 2014.\n\nCris"

The country's focus in recent years on resource extraction has had both its good points and bad; good, because high energy and commodity prices kept Canada's economy humming during the economic downturn of recent years; bad, because resource extraction brings with it environmental controversy, such as the one surrounding the Keystone XL Pipeline. How Canada resolves these tensions, and builds an economy for the 21st century, is among the central questions facing the country."

I only made it 500 yards into Houston when I came across a staging area where ordinary people were conducting water rescues in the Beaumont Place neighbourhood of Houston, TX. In addition to the rescues, residents were able to walk against the current down a long road which is seen in the image. At first I went out on a boat with a couple from Louisiana to help and document several rescues. When we got back, I looked down the road and saw an almost perfect line of residents making the long walk to the staging area. I intentionally moved to a position so I could photograph them in a way that would convey the magnitude of this storm. I wanted to communicate that it was a never-ending line of residents struggling to get to safety and it would go on for days. Harvey was a very difficult and emotionally taxing assignment. My first instinct was to put down the camera and help. It is always hard to come to the realisation that I am most helpful when I am taking pictures. As an observer of suffering you have to believe that your images can make a difference.\" REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman/File photo SEARCH \"POY STORY\" FOR THIS STORY.

			"text": "Ekaterina Bodyagina\n\nI can still clearly remember that evening meal with my parents at our house in Samara. My mother was asking me the usual questions: \u201cWhen are you going to find a husband? When are you finally going to get married?\u201d Then my father said, \u201cMaybe she wants to be with a woman.\u201d My mother smacked him on the back of the head, as if he had said something stupid. It wasn\u2019t stupid to me. It was the truth. I said, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d My mother began to weep. To this day I don\u2019t known whether she was weeping in sadness or in joy, but she said, \u201cWe love you so much. You are our child, no matter what.\u201d At that moment I felt reassured, but also liberated. That dinner was almost five years ago. At the time I was playing football professionally in Russia, for top division teams like Ekostrom, CSK VVS and the national women\u2019s youth team. I then gave up my career for my true love, Jenja. We want to get married and we\u2019re saving up for a wedding in Las Vegas two years from now.\n\nAlena Lazareva\n\nIt\u2019s brutal in Russia for people like me. Homosexuality, especially in football, is taboo. Coming out is accompanied by the fear that our society will attack, like vultures, with moral accusations. Fingers are pointed at you: \u201cLook at her. There\u2019s something wrong with her! She shouldn\u2019t be playing soccer!\u201d To them, I\u2019d like to say that how I play football has nothing to do with whom I love. My sexuality has nothing to do with my athletic performance. Russian society does not take this view, however. It may lead to sponsors, club managers, and fans turning their backs on you. Your career is destroyed, and if your family won\u2019t accept you, your life as well. For this reason, no professional football player in Russia has ever spoken openly about his or her homosexuality. I, however, don\u2019t want to remain silent any longer. I want talk about it publicly, for the first time. Because I no longer have anything to fear. My football career has ended. The head of the company where I work now knows I\u2019m gay. My friends know, as do my parents, since that dinner five years ago. And I want to give encouragement to anyone who might find themselves in a similar situation. In my sport, we never made a secret of our sexuality amongst ourselves. In every team I played for, almost half of the players were gay. It\u2019s hard to say if that number is representative for the sport, but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s much different in other teams. Football also helped me to better understand my sexuality. I can remember quite clearly the moment when I understood who I am. We were playing in the Russian city of Krymsk. Just before we went to sleep, my teammates were talking about how women can also be with other women. I wasn\u2019t part of the conversation, but as I lay under my blanket, I thought, \u201cYes! Finally it all makes sense.\u201d I felt liberated after that, and began to speak openly about the subject.\n\nAlena Lazareva\n\nBut I also know many people in my sport who have built up a heterosexual facade which they hide behind. Many have married and have children. Others have a girlfriend, but don\u2019t show themselves together in photos on social media. They go to events alone or with a male friend. And when journalists ask them with whom they sleep, they skirt around the issue. Those not familiar with Russia\u2019s sports media might be surprised that such questions get asked at press conferences. That\u2019s the reality, however. Just the suspicion of being gay makes you a target. I never had these experiences myself. It may be because I wasn\u2019t famous enough. But I know how it feels to present a different life to others. After I met Jenja, she gave me three days to decide \u2013 to be with her, and leave Samara for Moscow, or to leave her. I was still playing professionally in Samara at the time. I knew that, if I wanted to fulfil my dream of playing for the national team, I couldn\u2019t move to Moscow. So it wasn\u2019t an easy decision. Whenever I thought of Jenja, my heart would race and I\u2019d get butterflies in my stomach. On the other hand, playing football was all that I knew. Love won in the end. But how was I going to explain to my parents that I was moving to Moscow for a woman? So I created a double life. I told them that I was switching to a team in the capital, and would be living with a friend. And during those first weeks together with Jenja, I told my parents stories about my training and my new club. I did this for two months, and then I flew back to Samara and came clean. To this day, I\u2019m not sure what my parents really thought at that moment. But I know that my father suffered. He never let me see that. But my mother once told me that my father couldn\u2019t sleep for weeks after that evening.\n\nAlena Lazareva"

			"text": "OTTAWA \u2014 Donald Trump may have a world view incompatible with fellow global leaders, but his presence is still desired at the G7, representatives from most of its member states told HuffPost Canada Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, expressed deep frustration after the United States president used a national security clause to hit his country's most stable political and military allies with punitive tariffs on aluminum and steel imports.\n\n\"It has been a tense and tough G7,\" Le Maire said in Whistler, B.C., where the G7 finance ministers were gathered. \"It has been far more a G6 plus one than a G7. We regret that our common work at the level of the G7 has been put at risk by the decisions taken by the American administration on trade and on tariffs.\"\n\nLe Maire tweeted Tuesday that if the U.S. wants to \"renew its dialogue with its historical allies, it was up to them to take the first step and show willingness to co-operate with clear signs of de-escalation.\"\n\nCanada, which is hosting the meeting of the world's top liberal democracies in Charlevoix, Que., Friday and Saturday, refused to set conditions on the Americans' participation. Trump is still expected to attend the gathering, a senior government official said.\n\nAny musings about a G6 being more productive without the U.S. president would send the wrong message, another senior official said.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that we are going to make the G7 as productive as we can,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad, told HuffPost.\n\nThe forum's topics \u2014 economic growth and the future of work, gender equality, climate change and oceans protection, peace and security \u2014 were chosen as areas where common ground should be achievable.\n\nBut the trade dispute threatens to dominate the talks.\n\n\"There are going to be issues which we don't agree on, and that's always the case, but we are expecting to have frank discussions and good conversations about them,\" Ahmad simply said.\n\nWhile it is impossible for Trudeau to disinvite Trump, Fen Hampson, esteemed chancellor's professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs in Ottawa, said it would be a more productive session without him.\n\n\"You can't disinvite. But should Trump for whatever reason decide that he doesn't want to come \u2014 and he has a potential excuse with preparation for the upcoming meeting with the North Korean leader \u2014 I think it would be a much better meeting, because then those countries who are deeply affected from the trade war he has initiated could discuss strategy and how to maintain a common front.\"\n\nColin Robertson, vice-president and fellow at Canadian Global Affairs Institute, thinks it important to have the U.S. at the G7 so that it doesn't just look like a \"whine session.\" While the leaders' summit this Friday and Saturday may end up being a disaster, Robertson argues that the real value of having the U.S. on board is that they are involved in all the meetings leading up to the leaders' summit. \"It is sort of a continuity for the future.\"\n\nIn 2014, the major liberal democracies of the world threw Russia out of the G8, turning the elite club back into the G7. The forum of big industrialized nations, which has existed for more than 40 years, includes: Canada, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and, although not included in the tally, representatives from the European Union.\n\nKicking the United States out of the G7, however, would be a big move that could prove counterproductive.\n\n\"I think they [should] keep it the way it is and just hope for a president who will take a different view,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"The whole thing is about tying Gulliver down, and even though this Gulliver may not be for tying down, at least getting him in the room is important.\"\n\nWhile the G7's outcomes are usually based on consensus, the U.S. has been sidelined in other forums recently. At the OECD's ministerial council meeting last month, the chair noted that everyone had agreed on the importance of multilateralism as the most effective model to build peace and security, but one member, without naming the Americans.\n\nTrudeau rejects Trump's push for bilateral trade talks:\n\nWednesday, Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects the G7 talks to be \"contentious\" and hoped that the members would not \"keep watering down\" commitments just to get Trump onboard. \"There must not be a compromise simply for the sake of a compromise,\" Merkel said, according to an Associated Press report. Having Canada, as host, issue a final statement rather than a joint communiqu\u00e9 might be more honest, she said.\n\nIn Ottawa, Eva Ricarda Willems, the first secretary at the German embassy, stressed her country's firm commitment to a multilateral approach.\n\nIn a shared press release, Germany noted the U.S. decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs was a move universally condemned by its allies as a violation of international trade rules.\n\n\"The measure threatens to escalate into a downward spiral, which will ultimately be detrimental to everyone,\" Merkel's government said.\n\nEric Navel, France's communications counsellor at the embassy in Ottawa, noted his government's message championing strong multilateralism. French President Emmanuel Macron is in Canada's capital Wednesday for a two-day bilateral visit ahead of the summit. Macron and Trudeau have both tried to charm Trump to no avail. Macron did not get the outcome he wished in safeguarding the Iran deal, Trudeau is still waiting on Trump to finalize NAFTA talks.\n\n'They don't really want to kick the Americans out'\n\nA diplomat from one of the G7 countries who did not want to be identified because he didn't have clearance to speak with the media told HuffPost that there were a lot of other issues beyond trade, such as North Korea, that need to be discussed with the United States.\n\n\"Sometimes we don't agree on certain issues but it is important that G7 countries continue to engage, because we share fundamental values, like human rights and democracy, and so on. Of course, democracy is now challenged,\" he added with a nervous laugh. \"But we respect, the democratic system.\"\n\nAnother diplomat who did not want his country identified echoed the sentiment that the G7 is a long-standing alliance that can \"maturely address political differences\" in a full and frank manner.\n\nAn official with the Italian embassy in Ottawa, Francesco Corsaro, said his government is a strong G7 supporter. \"We want the G7 to stay G7.\"\n\n\"They don't really want to kick the Americans out,\" Hampson told HuffPost. \"It's the biggest economy in the world and the leader of the Western alliances. But when it is behaving badly, a time out isn't necessarily a bad thing.\""

Indian banks want to recover more than $1 billion that Indian authorities say Kingfisher owes.\n\nThe British court order allows the UK High Court Enforcement Officer to enter Mallya's properties in Britain, giving a legal option to Indian banks to try and recover the dues, media reports said, citing the court decision.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to confirm the court decision.\n\nSeparately, the Indian government's Enforcement Directorate, which fights financial crimes, has filed an application to seek to declare Mallya a \"fugitive economic offender\" and sought to confiscate 125 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) worth of his assets.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, Mallya said he was trying to sell assets worth about $2.04 billion to repay creditors.\n\nMallya, who denies the charges against him, said any objection by the Enforcement Directorate or India's federal police to his proposals to sell assets \"will clearly demonstrate that there is an agenda against me beyond recovery of dues to Public Sector Banks.\"\n\n\"I have become the 'Poster Boy' of bank default and a lightning rod of public anger,\" Mallya said in his statement last week."

			"text": "Vasant Dhar is a data scientist, and a professor at the Stern School of Business and the Center for Data Science at New York University, where his research focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning. He is also the founder of a machine learning-based hedge fund.\n\nIn this interview, he explains why he thinks data policies will determine the future of nation states, why it is it crucial to build proper data infrastructure, and why data is the new oil, but not the new water.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nYou have said that data policies will shape the future of nation states. You distinguish between four such policies: the US model of data monetisation, the EU/Japan model as defined by the newly minted General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), China's use of data for control, and the India model, where you say data is used for inclusion. Which is the best model?\n\nThere isn't a best one. We've seen what happened with the monetisation model: it led to a disaster in terms of people exploiting that platform in ways you had not even envisioned, because there were not restrictions or constraints on that data. The GDPR framework imposes costs because businesses are scared about how to do things. They are like, \"We are not even going to offer these services because we might get into trouble.\"\n\nSo you might argue that GDPR is going to introduce friction. The Chinese model \u2013 great for innovation, but very risky from the standpoint of misuse and centralised authority.\n\nIn India, the problems around data are somewhat different from the US, where there are concerns about people hacking platforms.\n\nIn India, the emphasis is on inclusion. The small business guy can't get a loan, and is invisible to the mainstream. He wants his transactions to be visible to the bank, wants his transaction to be visible to the lender for legitimacy.\n\nSo anything that facilitates more inclusion will lead to better markets, more efficient markets, better pricing. A guy shouldn't be paying 10% a day to get a loan to put his cart out on the street. Someone should be able to say, \"This guy is a pretty good credit risk. He pays his staff at the end of the day, I've seen his transactions.\" None of that stuff was visible earlier. The fact that it is now visible is a potential data empowerment avenue.\n\nDo we actually have an Indian model? We don't even have a data law.\n\nI'm just calling it the India model. Its probably the least well defined of the four. The reason I call it that \u2013 is that's where I see it headed. There is so much of a need for inclusion of people into the mainstream, much more so than China. So that will be an important part of how data policy develops in India.\n\nThe rest of it will probably be an amalgam of the US and the EU: This is an open democracy, there are going to be concerns about misuse, there are going to be concerns about big brother.\n\nIndia will probably end up with this inclusion empowerment thing on the one hand, because its needed and lots of people want it. On the other side, probably the more affluent part of society will say, \"Hey, I don't want my data shared.\" That will probably be driven by whats happening in the US and EU.\n\nIs there is a problem with an argument that says poor people don't need privacy as much as rich people?\n\nIt is not like they don't need privacy, but they need more 'other stuff', to which privacy takes a back seat. There are other things that are more important to them. Maybe in the Maslow's hierarchy, privacy comes a bit higher.\n\nOne of the debates around Aadhaar has been the flip-side of inclusion: Exclusion. If the database is paramount, what happens if you are excluded from the database?\n\nI guess the question is \u2014 is that a systemic problem or is that a problem of exceptions?\n\nI don't know the answer, but I suspect it is not a systemic problem. I suspect that it is not tens of millions of people who can't get in. I don't know what the numbers are, but I suspect they are small.\n\nIf the numbers are small, we should address that problem \u2014 why is that happening? Those problems need to be addressed on a case by case process.\n\nIs there a problem with using the silicon-valley model of \"build the plane while you are flying\" to roll out essential services?\n\nThere are couple of ways of looking at this \u2014 one is that you are always building. As you get data you are constantly improving. So, the process of product improvement never ends.\n\nThere is always a risk \u2014 you have the problem of Rumsfeldian unknowns. You just don't know what the unknown unknowns are until you actually try it out. Then you can see them, and then you can fix them.\n\nBut the alternative to that is paralysis \u2014 then you never get off the ground.\n\nWe've done a spate of stories on how Indian state governments, like Andhra Pradesh, are inter-linking everything from caste, religion, home addresses, and medical records, to build detailed profiles of citizens.\n\nPeople saying, \"Hey, this great, this is a cool idea, we can link this \u2014 we can do this, we can do that.\" That's dangerous, because it does not apply the test of intent.\n\nThe test of intent is: Is it reasonable to assume that the person who provided this information would have no problem with this information being used in this way?\n\nIf I buy something online, that doesn't require you to ship me anything, and you ask me for my home address. Well, why are you asking me for my address? What's your intent?\n\nAnd say I gave you my address, and you started using that to guess my sexual orientation or something else. The question the data collector must ask is, \"Hey, is this consistent with why this person gave me the data? Would they have no problem with me also inferring their sexual orientation?\"\n\nIs it a problem that India still does not have a data privacy law? That anyone can do anything with any form of data?\n\nYes, it is dangerous because data is a potentially potent form of information that can be used for many things. You don't want to do the wrong thing \u2014 you don't want privacy laws that are not well thought out. That's worse than not having law.\n\nBut by now there are sufficient experiences around data use, misuse, and hacks. The internet economy is 20 plus years old now. It isn't new. In this day and age, there should be data privacy laws.\n\nShould government departments enter the data market? The Indian railways is exploring ways of selling user data gathered from its online booking portal, by divesting its shares in IRCTC.\n\nGovernments have a different object function from companies: Companies exist for their shareholders, governments exist for their citizens.\n\nThat implies their roles and responsibilities around data should be different. Companies should monetise data. You should expect something very different from the government.\n\nThe government should not be in the business of making money from data. They should be in the business of providing better services, and if they do it through data that is well and good, but they should not be in the business of selling that data.\n\nSomething about this just rings strange to me \u2014 that \u2014 \"Well, we'll divest it and all of this data that was given to us as the custodians is now going to someone \u2014 who we don't even know \u2014 who is buying it and paying for it.\"\n\nEveryone now says, \"Data as the new oil.\" Is there a case for saying, \"Data is the new water.\" I.e, it is a free public good that should not be monetised?\n\nNo. Water is a commodity: It is uniform it is always the same, it always has the same chemical structure.\n\nDifferent types of data have different kinds of risks associated with them. Someone asked me this question in response to my Hindustan Times editorial, \"Shouldn't all government data be public?\" My answer is, \"No.\"\n\nYou need to assess the risks of making this data public. What if terrorists get it? Do you really want to share your data with everyone? I don't think so. Not all of it. Maybe some of it, where there is no risk. I think there needs to be some consideration of risk in making decisions about data."

Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on Aug. 15, 1947 \u2014 the day the British colonization of India officially ended. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of India\u2019s national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country.\n\nSinai is also gifted with special telepathic powers and soon discovers that 1,000 other children born between midnight and 1 a.m. that day also have gifts. Set in the context of actual historical events, Rushdie\u2019s magical realism gives shape to the harsh realities of post-colonial India.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely delighted that Midnight\u2019s Children will have a new life on Netflix, and greatly look forward to working with them to help create it,\u201d said Rushdie, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008 for his contributions to literature.\n\nThe author, who hadn\u2019t tweeted since the 2016 presidential election, also shared the news on Twitter:"

For the love of God, please don\u2019t confuse pasta water with any of these.)\n\nBecause pasta is made of flour, it releases starch into the cooking water as it boils, creating a white, cloudy liquid that we often deem \u201cdirty\u201d and then dump down the sink.\n\nBig mistake. That\u2019s the liquid gold we\u2019re talking about.\n\nWhy would you want to keep that cloudy liquid, you may ask? Because it\u2019ll help emulsify and thicken your sauce. Now you\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cBut why would I want to emulsify my sauce? Who even cares?\u201d\n\nEmulsification makes a difference, as science and taste buds prove.\n\nAll too often, a plate of spaghetti is encircled by a watery, red puddle. You know what we\u2019re talking about. It pools around the edge of your plate and ruins a gorgeous plate of pasta. That puddle results when the water and oil in your pasta and sauce separate from each other.\n\nHere\u2019s where emulsification comes in.\n\nEmulsification is the process of blending two liquids that would otherwise repel each other \u2015 in the case of pasta, it\u2019s oil and water \u2015 into a smooth, inseparable mixture. The starch in your pasta water, as luck would have it, is an emulsifying agent and also a thickener. So if you save some of your pasta water and then slowly mix a ladlefull of it into sauce, you\u2019re binding together the liquids and oils, creating something creamy and thick that won\u2019t ever separate into a puddly mess.\n\nThere\u2019s another benefit of using pasta water: By not rinsing your pasta, you\u2019re keeping a nice coating of starch that\u2019ll bind the pasta itself to the sauce, creating yet even more harmony on your plate. (Some people also claim pasta water makes your dish more flavorful, but that\u2019s for super refined palates.)\n\nIf you cook alternative pastas made with lentils, black beans, brown rice or just about anything else, those are all wonderfully starchy as well, and that water also can be used as liquid gold.\n\nSerious Eats was skeptical about whether laypeople could tell the difference between a regular sauce and a sauce that\u2019s been emulsified with pasta water, so the website conducted a taste test that compared three different preparations of pasta. The one that used pasta water in its sauce won by a landslide.\n\nPasta water works its magic in just about every kind of sauce, not just tomato. It can make an Alfredo sauce less greasy, and it can give a silky texture to a pesto.\n\nHere\u2019s how to save your pasta water.\n\nChoose one of the following methods:\n\nIf you insist on dumping your pasta into a giant colander, first make sure you\u2019ve ladled out a couple cups of the cooking liquid and saved it in a bowl.\n\nOr you can use a pot with a pasta strainer insert. It allows you to just lift up the strainer when the pasta is ready, reserving all the liquid in the big pot. These things are magical.\n\nFor long pastas like spaghetti and fettuccine, you can just use a pair of tongs to move the cooked pasta to a saucepan.\n\nFish shorter pastas like macaroni and penne out of the water with a spider skimmer ladle.\n\nNow watch the masters use pasta water in their sauces.\n\nMixing pasta water into your sauce takes a little bit of finesse. But this is certainly nothing new, as pasta makers have been doing it for ages. So let\u2019s watch a few of the best make some incredible sauces.\n\nFirst is Frankie Celenza, one of our favorite modern-day pasta makers and YouTubers. He\u2019s been preaching the benefits of saucing with pasta water since he first showed his enthusiastic face on our screens. Watch him work his magic with pasta water in three specific applications below, and then fall down the rabbit hole of his YouTube feed, because his videos are enchanting.\n\nHere, Celenza saves a sweet onion and tomato sauce with the help of some pasta water:"

Read Trump\u2019s letter (story continues below):\n\nTrump Letter by Anonymous FBZLGr on Scribd\n\nSouth Korean officials appeared blindsided by the announcement. \u201cWe are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means,\u201d said spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Anna Fifield. South Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency reported. It\u2019s also unclear whether State Department officials were aware of Trump\u2019s decision before he released the letter. When asked if the announcement came as a surprise, a staffer in the office that works on North Korea issues said he had to check with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. Speaking at the White House later Thursday, Trump said he had just spoken with military officials, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan. They are \u201cready for foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea,\u201d he said, adding that \u201can unfortunate situation is forced upon us.\u201d \u201cHopefully positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea. If they don\u2019t, we are more ready than we have ever been before,\u201d he said, apparently a threat of military action. On a call with reporters, a senior White House official asserted that Trump \u201chad constant communication with our allies,\u201d but did not explain why U.S. allies were caught off guard. The official did not say whether Trump and Kim had spoken directly. Of the letter, the official said Trump had \u201cdictated every word himself.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement came hours after North Korean officials threatened to cancel the summit, angered by recent comments from Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, who compared North Korea with Libya.\n\nKCNA KCNA / Reuters North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks at a meeting in Pyongyang on May 18."

It\u2019s defined as being \u201cmade with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra-virgin olive oil.\u201d It\u2019s a pared-down, more flavorful version of what Americans think of as cheese pizza, and it looks like this:\n\nBefore you even question its name, it\u2019s possible that, if you\u2019re American, you don\u2019t even know what pizza Margherita is in the first place. (If you do, we apologize for the condescension and hope you forgive us.) There\u2019s a lot of confusion about the difference between cheese pizza, plain pizza and Margherita pizza .\n\nHave you ever ordered a pizza Margherita and wondered why it\u2019s even called that?\n\nSo how did it get its name? The most widespread \u2015 though not undisputed \u2015 belief suggests that Margherita of Savoy, onetime queen consort of Italy, was visiting Naples with her husband, King Umberto I (who happened to be her first cousin), in June 1889. This came on the heels of the unification of northern and southern Italy, and southern Italy was in need of a morale boost after its loss of independence.\n\nEnter Queen Margherita and her appetite.\n\nLegend has it that the queen tired of the gourmet French food she\u2019d been served on the trip, and asked the most famous pizzamaker in Naples, Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi, to make her pizza.\n\nThe story goes that the pizza she liked best was made with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil, which just happened to represent the three colors of the Italian flag. Convenient, huh? Esposito named the dish after Queen Margherita, and the rest is disputed history.\n\nAn alternate theory revolves around the fact that the word margherita translates to \u201cdaisy\u201d in Italian, so some suggest the pizza got its name from the daisy-shaped arrangement of mozzarella and basil on top of the pizza.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, pizza Margherita is delicious. If you can\u2019t get some from your local pizzeria, make yourself a pie. We\u2019ve got 29 different recipes."

When that didn\u2019t work, she asked to be fired. It\u2019s not clear if this ended up happening.\n\nThe actress has previously said that she nearly quit acting earlier in her career after having a \u201cwake-up moment\u201d regarding sexual discrimination in Hollywood."

			"text": "1. Moyane damaged SARS's reputation right from the start\n\nLess than a month after Moyane's arrival at SA Revenue Service (SARS) headquarters in Brooklyn, Pretoria, the Sunday Times published the first in a series of false reports about a so-called \"rogue unit\" operating illegally within SARS. Moyane, new in his job, jumped into action and suspended all and sundry without answering any queries from his own management team. Any effort by his senior executives to attempt to protect SARS's reputation or to respond to the Sunday Times was thwarted by Moyane, who seemed content to let the stories and leaks engulf the organisation. When an exasperated Adrian Lackay confronted him after the umpteenth Sunday Times \"expos\u00e9\" he told Lackay his job at SARS was to \"clear the air\".\n\n2. Moyane destroyed SARS's enforcement capabilities\n\nWith the departure of group executive for tax and customs enforcement and investigations, Johann van Loggerenberg, and his colleagues, five specialised and highly skilled units were disbanded: National Projects, which investigated underworld figures, such as Mark Lifman, Lolly Jackson and Radovan Krecjir, and the illegal cigarette trade; Central Projects, which investigated Dave King, a billionaire businessman who battled Sars for 13 years over a tax bill of more than R3-billion, Zuma friend Robert Huang and Julius Malema; the Tactical Intervention Unit, which covered border posts; the High-Risk Investigations Unit, which worked on high-risk projects alongside sister units; and the Evidence Management and Technical Support Unit, which consisted of world-class forensic and IT laboratories, as well as tax, customs, audit and other experts.\n\n3. Moyane broke what was working\n\nIn late 2014, months after he arrived, he appointed consultants Bain and Co. as well as Gartner Inc. to review SARS's operating model. This entailed a massive overhaul of the organisation. Moyane, seemingly empowered by presidential fiat, even ignored then-minister of finance Pravin Gordhan's requests to desist from his plans until Treasury could study the potential impact. Inexplicably, Bain even recommended that one of SARS's success stories, the Large Business Centre, be restructured. Moyane also sought to clear out the upper decks of SARS's leadership, appointing 45 new executives in a year. But by February 2016, more than 50 executives had left, taking along with them institutional knowledge and experience of tax collection and enforcement to the private sector. This year, government has a R50-billion hole in its budget after revenue came up short. It's a problem.\n\n4. The Makwakwa cover-up\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Moyane received a report from the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) detailing alleged fraud and corruption by his second-in-command, Jonas Makwakwa and his partner, Kelly-Ann Elskie, who also works at SARS. Moyane never laid a complaint with the Hawks, and only suspended Makwakwa four months later, in September 2016. At the time there was no indication that the Hawks were investigating Makwakwa, and Moyane showed no urgency in dealing with the matter in terms of anti-corruption legislation.\n\n5. A soft landing for an alleged money-launderer\n\nMakwakwa was suspended on full pay for a year, before he returned to SARS after being exonerated by an internal investigation and disciplinary hearing. The terms of reference for the investigation into Makwakwa, conducted by law firm Hogan Lovells, were seemingly watered down to allow Moyane's man to escape censure. It originally included quite serious investigations into tax evasion and receipts of dodgy payments, but eventually eschewed the question of the payments identified by the FIC. And, as Moyane said on Wednesday, after Makwakwa's resignation: \"He regards this as being an opportune moment for him to exit SARS after being cleared of all the allegations of misconduct through a formal disciplinary hearing.\" No harm, no foul?"

			"text": "Rajkumar Hirani's Sanju starring Ranbir Kapoor as Sanjay Dutt has shattered the previously-held record of Salman Khan's Tiger Zinda Hai, and earned an astounding Rs 120 crore in its opening weekend. The film has also resurrected Ranbir Kapoor's flailing box-office performance, bringing him back into the coveted 100-crore club that determines a star's equity in Bollywood.\n\nWhile the film is doing brisk business at the turnstiles, we need to acknowledge how deeply problematic it is. Hirani, master of emotional tearjerkers, uses his deft storytelling to weave a narrative that is excessively sympathetic towards Dutt, who happens to be his close friend and collaborator on the lucrative Munnabhai films.\n\nPrior to Sanju 's release, producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Hirani and Kapoor assured the media that the film wasn't an attempt to glorify or whitewash Dutt's crimes. Yet, the film's treatment and its companionable gaze paint Dutt as a victim and not the convict \u2014 that he was \u2014 under the Arms Act in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case.\n\nThe bias is established early in a scene where Dutt and his wife, Manyata (Dia Mirza), are on the lookout for a biographer to tell his side of the story. It is all downhill from there, as scene after scene makes clear that this is a Dutt-approved whitewash, rather than a clear-eyed appraisal of one of Bollywood's most enigmatic figures.\n\nThere's not a scene that looks at Dutt's life critically or with a sense of serious interrogation.\n\nWhile Hirani could have put Dutt's reckless actions in context, he chose to hold everyone \u2014 except for Sanjay Dutt \u2014 responsible for the star's plight.\n\nIn the film, Dutt becomes a drug addict because he was a gullible young man, crushed under the celebrity of his famous father, and who was led into the world of narcotics by a scheming peddler (a very over-the-top Jim Sarbh). He turns into a compulsive womaniser but that aspect is dealt with in a comedic manner, that minimises the extent of damage it caused to the women he wronged. He hid the AK 56 rifles because he was 'protecting' his family and got caught at the 'wrong time' and the media blew up the case.\n\nIn fact, the media-bashing is the most troubling part of the film where Hirani makes Dutt appear as if he was 'framed' by the media. The makers constantly deflect blame to insulate their leading man and what helps the film in pushing this warped narrative is that the leading man is really, really good at his job, as is a stellar supporting cast with Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt and Vicky Kaushal as Sanju's close friend. Kapoor immerses himself into the character and becomes Dutt, barring minor inconsistencies where his voice falters to sound more like Ranbir and less like the character.\n\nAt a time when newsrooms across the world are facing serious threats, and the establishment is determined to discredit the press, Hirani's decision to paint the media as the villain \u2014 going as far as including a song where Kapoor and Dutt literally trash newspapers \u2014 is deeply irresponsible.\n\nWhile the media may have misreported the trial, Dutt didn't go to jail because of said reports. He went to jail because he hid powerful weapons sourced from Abu Salem, a terrorist convicted in the 1993 Mumbai Blasts case.\n\nHirani also chooses to exclude relationships that are too difficult to gloss over. His sisters, Priya and Namrata, are practically voiceless and his difficult relationship with daughter Trishala or his ex-wives isn't even referenced to, as that wouldn't easily fit into the blameless-hero-narrative.\n\nDutt (in)famously said that his daughter, Trishala, had dreams of becoming an actor and he wanted \"to break her legs.\" None of those misogynistic, patriarchal remarks find mention in the film. The only time the film shows some self-awareness is when Dutt reads out a speech to his father where he says, \"You deserved a better son.\"\n\nThe unchecked privilege, the underlying victim syndrome, the consistent attempt to absolve Dutt of his actions, and then the media-blaming, make Sanju an ideal film for our post-truth times.\n\nA biography is great when it stares at the truth with an unflinching eye, not with a jaddu ki jhappi.\n\nAfter Sanju, let's hope we don't end up getting a Sallu.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

That\u2019s the name Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip decided upon for their direct descendants back in 1960. Philip, formerly a prince of Greece and Denmark, adopted the last name Mountbatten when he became a naturalized British citizen ahead of his wedding to Elizabeth in 1947; as for Windsor, Elizabeth\u2019s grandfather King George V declared that to be the family and house name in 1917. (Prior to that, the British royal family did not have a formal surname; rather, they used their house or dynasty name).\n\nAccording to Koenig, the hyphenated surname was created for male-line descendants of the queen who do not bear the HRH prince or princess title. That\u2019s why most of the royals you\u2019re familiar with rarely, if ever, use it.\n\nSome royals opt to use their territorial designation as their last name instead, as both William and Harry did when they served in the military; at that time, they went by William Wales and Harry Wales."

			"text": "JGI/Jamie Grill via Getty Images Maintaining separate finances can make sense for your relationship and your wallet.\n\nAfter walking down the aisle, couples often see combining finances as the obvious next step. But times are changing, and some financial \"rules\" are meant to be broken.\n\nA recent report by Bank of America showed that while 13 percent of baby boomer couples maintain separate finances, 28 percent of millennials keep their money separate.\n\nFor some couples, maintaining separate bank accounts, credit cards and budgets is simply a matter of convenience. For others, it can provide a greater sense of personal security and harmony in their marriage.\n\nThat seems to be especially true for women. Here's why these six married women bucked tradition and maintain separate finances from their spouses:\n\n1. Because my partner's been burned in the past\n\n\"My partner and I have been together for eight years. I send half of all the bill money to her account every month. One reason we have done this is due to her past relationship, where finances were combined and upon separation, she had to eventually file for bankruptcy due to her previous spouse getting a car in her name. She suffers from anxiety, and one of her triggers is finances. By us keeping them separate, she can ensure all the household bills are paid and everything is in good standing. It has worked, and we never have arguments over finances. Even though our finances are separate, we don't worry about who pays for what or how the money is spent.\" \u2015 Raigan\n\n2. Because it's easier\n\n\"Pure laziness. We have bills each person is responsible for and it's easier for us to keep it all how we are used to than to do math \ud83d\ude02\" \u2015 Jessica\n\n3. Because we enjoy our independence\n\n\"My husband and I have been married for 16 years. We started with a joint account because we thought that's what you're supposed to do, and I was not working anyway. About six years in, we got separate accounts at two totally different banks. If I remember correctly, it was because we kept spending everything and were living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nWe split the bills. Not like 'the electric bill is $100, so you pay $50'. That's ridiculous. But I'll pay all the utilities, and he pays the rent. I pay my own car payment, phone bill and credit cards, and he pays his own and our car insurance. He pays more in bills than I do just because he makes more than I do. I love being able to spend what I want without having to explain. 'What the hell did you spend $300 on in Target?!!' Nope! I do not go through that.\n\nAs a woman, I think it is important to have and manage your own money and have something put away in savings \u2015 just in case!\" \u2015 Stef\n\n4. Because we trust each other\n\n\"We had both been married before when we got married 33 years ago, and decided that it was just easier to keep things separate. He's a CPA, I'm a book publisher and trainer. He has always made more money than I, but my finances have grown over the years with job changes.\n\nWe both have shared personal and business accounts, but have never written a cheque on either account. When we owned a home, he took care of the mortgage, I took care of the utilities and food. He took care of the big-ticket items and medical, I took care of all the kid's stuff. He takes care of our investments and keeps me informed.\n\nOver the years, we've just gone with the flow depending upon the needs of the time as to who is paying for what. His hobby is betting on the horses and I've never asked how much he won or lost because I trust him. I spend money on theatre tickets, stuff for the kids or grandkids or clothes. He's never asked me how much I've spent. It took us a while to get it all figured out, but I believe the key is flexibility and trust. It's worked for us.\" \u2015 Glenda\n\n5. Because we have different money management styles\n\n\"Love it. I balance a budget and pay most of the bills, track shared expenses, etc. At the end of the month, I balance/reconcile and Venmo requests the money he owes me for the shared expenses, which include utilities, mortgage, cars, groceries, investments, etc. We both manage our own personal non-shared expenses. We do discuss goals for investments that would ultimately have a shared responsibility.\n\nThis way, my OCD budgeting doesn't impact his lower-key approach \u2015 we both prioritise important shared funds but maintain independence. We have a 'spend your own money on whatever you want' mentality with no judgment and no permission-seeking.\" \u2015 Kelly\n\n6. Because my ex put us in debt\n\n\"When I was married, my husband and I shared a checking account. He was in school and earning very little. On my teacher's salary, I was paying two car payments, a house payment \u2015 all of it. His meagre student loan was paying for rock-climbing equipment, Starbucks coffees and daily lunches out while he threw away the lunch I made every day. The last year before we split, he was finally making $20,000. But we were so deep in debt, we had agreed that we would work to pay off credit cards. Unfortunately, his lifestyle was not having it. Fun times.\n\nMy current partner pays his bills and I pay mine. I never ask him where he is spending his money, and he never asks me. As long as the bills are paid, we are good. If he is running short, I get the utility bills. If I am running short, he will pick up the groceries. I will NEVER share a bank account again.\" \u2015 Meg\n\nLast names were withheld to protect respondents' privacy and the privacy of their families.

			"text": "Niall Aslam and Samira Mighty\u2019s decision to leave \u2018Love Island\u2019 of their own accord may well come as a shock to some fans of the ITV2 dating show, who are more used to seeing contestants leaving via the more traditional methods of either losing out in a recoupling or being given the boot by the British public. However, while this is the case for the majority of Islanders who\u2019ve stayed in the villa over the past four series, a handful have elected to leave either for their own reasons, or because producers have prematurely called time on their stint on the Island. Here are all the \u2018Love Island\u2019 stars to leave via the back door\u2026 Rykard Jenkins (Walked - series 2)\n\nRykard was the first \u2018Love Island\u2019 contestant to ever choose to walk away from the villa, deciding - like Samira - that his blossoming romance with co-star Rachel Fenton was more important than staying the course on the ITV2 reality show. He and Rachel stayed together after their series ended, eventually announcing their split almost 18 months later, though they insisted the break-up was an amicable one, with Rachel tweeting that she \u201cwished [Rykard] all the best for the future\u201d. Malia Arkian (Removed - series 2)\n\nRykard\u2019s decision to leave was the first in \u2018Love Island\u2019 history, but he wasn\u2019t the first of that year\u2019s contestants to leave in unusual circumstances. Just a week before he threw in the towel, newcomer Malia Arkian was removed from the villa - and the show - after just one night, following a physical altercation with fellow Islander Kady McDermott. While Malia\u2019s outburst cost her a place on the show, Kady made it all the way to the final, finishing in third place that year. Sophie Gradon (Walked - series 2)\n\nDuring her time on the show, Sophie - who sadly died in June 2018, at the age of 32 - made \u2018Love Island\u2019 history as one half of the first (and, at the time of writing, only) same-sex couple to ever appear on the show. She chose to walk just two days after coupling up with co-star Katie Salmon, who eventually ended the show in fourth place, alongside partner Adam Maxted. Zara Holland (Walked - series 2)\n\nProbably the most memorable \u2018Love Island\u2019 walk-out in the show\u2019s four series, Zara left days after it revealed that a sexual encounter in the villa had cost her the title of Miss GB. It should be pointed out that Zara\u2019s exit had nothing to do with her controversial decrowning, though, as she actually opted to leave due to an illness in her family. Niall Aslam (Walked - series 4)\n\nFor the entirety of series three, no contestants were thrown out or chose to leave of their own accord, a pattern that was broken when Niall announced he was leaving just over a week into the fourth series. At the moment, little is known of Niall\u2019s reasoning, with a \u2018Love Island\u2019 spokesperson claiming he made the decision to walk away for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. Niall was the second contestant to leave the villa in 2018, following Kendall Rae-Knight, who was dumped after six days. Emma and Eve Ryan (Ejected - original \u2018Love Island\u2019 series 2)\n\nDon\u2019t forget, the current run of \u2018Love Island\u2019 was actually a reboot of a show first shown on ITV in the 2000s, in which a load of celebrities looked for love in the sun. Glamour model twins Emma and Eve Ryan were late arrivals in the show\u2019s fourth week, but were thrown out by producers after just five days. Intriguingly, no explanation was ever given as to why they were given the boot, though they were given a send-off. Shane Lynch (Walked - original \u2018Love Island\u2019 series 2)\n\nFormer Boyzone singer Shane Lynch lasted five weeks in the original \u2018Love Island\u2019 villa, until he decided to call it a day, to try and make it up with a woman back home. He said at the time: \u201cI\u2019ve come to a point of realisation what\u2019s right for me and some mistakes I\u2019ve made which I need to go home and put right and that\u2019s to do with a woman at home. \u201cI wanted to complete this journey, I wanted to experience what this whole show was about but there is nothing and nobody that comes close to what I already know and I need to fight for that.\u201d Dennis Rodman (Walked - original \u2018Love Island\u2019 series 2)\n\nBasketball legend Dennis Rodman wasn\u2019t even an official \u2018Love Island\u2019 contestant, instead being brought in as a \u201cguest\u201d to try and spice things up in the show\u2019s third week, and he still didn\u2019t make it as long as he was meant to. Dennis left the villa four days into filming, when a comment he made about his intention to \u201cf***\u201d fellow contestant Colleen Shannon went down poorly with the rest of the celebrities. As tension grew, Dennis chose to pack his bags, stating: \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy. I don\u2019t hit people but I don\u2019t need to be in this environment so I want to keep it that way.\u201d Steve-O (Walked - original \u2018Love Island\u2019 series 2)\n\nSimilarly, \u2018Jackass\u2019 star Steve-O was also brought in as a guest, but chose to walk after two days, because his requests for beer and chocolate were refused by \u2018Love Island\u2019 bosses. Steve-O had stipulated prior to touching down in the \u2018Love Island\u2019 villa that he was sober. \u2018Love Island\u2019 continues on Thursday at 9pm on ITV2."

			"text": "MUMBAI/NEW DELHI - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pre-election gambit to sharply hike state-mandated prices for summer crops, including rice, may mean little to millions of farmers, as the government lacks the storage and funds needed to buy most of the produce.\n\nThe median increase in the so-called minimum support prices (MSPs) approved by the government on Wednesday was 25 percent, compared with 3-4 percent in the first four years in office for Modi, whose bid for a second term next year is expected to be much tougher than his landslide victory in 2014.\n\nThe government announces MSPs for most crops to set a benchmark, but state agencies mainly buy limited quantities of staples such as rice and wheat at those prices, restricting benefits of higher prices to only around 7 percent of the country's 263 million farmers, according to various studies.\n\nImplementing the scheme in full would be expensive, economists say. The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.\n\n\"With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,\" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.\"\n\nThe ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe government said its limited purchases could cost it 150 billion rupees ($2.18 billion) this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.\n\nMSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.\n\n\"What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?\" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in the western state of Maharashtra, who sold soybean at 2,700 rupees per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.\n\nA crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.\n\nHe called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.\n\nLACK OF STORAGE\n\nState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.\n\nThe food ministry told parliament bit.ly/2z8C3RO in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.\n\nThe ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.\n\n\"Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,\" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.\n\n\"This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.\"\n\nELECTION PLEDGE\n\nDuring election campaigning in 2014, Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.\n\nBut double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.\n\nBut Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.\n\nThe below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.\n\nThe latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.\n\n\"The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,\" he said."

The state minister, who is Shia Muslim, brooked no criticism of his boss, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath: a hindutva hardliner with a history of anti-Muslim rhetoric, who has been accused of inciting communal violence in eastern UP in 2007.\n\nThe BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2017 Assembly election, so Raza, a former state-level cricketer and a television actor who joined the BJP in 2013, was picked by Adityanath to be the sole Muslim in his cabinet.\n\nRaza spoke to HuffPost India shortly after announcing that government-aided madrassas in UP would have to do away with kurta pyjamas and introduce uniforms. Last year, the Adityanath government introduced NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) books in madrassas.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nSUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

There was a problem processing your signup; please try again later Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYoutube\n\nWhy does the UP government want to introduce uniforms in madrassas?\n\nThey [Muslim students] have been wearing kurta-pyjamas since 1947, but it is not the dress for madrassas. It is not an Islamic dress. Modi ji is talking about having the Koran in one hand and a laptop in another. If we want to make them part of the mainstream then we have to give them a mainstream education alongside religious education. They should think of becoming doctors and engineers.\n\nThe past governments, for the sake of votes, had given recognition to alim, fazil and munshi degrees in order to give them government jobs. Let's talk about the Congress, which has failed to provide modern education to Muslims since independence. Should they not have introduced the NCERT curriculum in madrassas? What right do they have to express sympathy for Muslims?\n\nDo you believe wearing a uniform can empower Muslims?\n\nBy wearing a uniform, they will feel part of the mainstream, not isolated from society. The past government kept them isolated for the sake of vote bank. Maulana Azad was the first education minister but the Muslim community remained without education. The uniforms will boost the confidence of the students. It will inspire them to think of going to IIT and IIM, become an IAS or IPS officer, not just munshis. You will see how this step will bring about massive change.\n\nIf the BJP genuinely believes in empowering Muslims, why did it not field a single Muslim candidate from UP in the 2017 state election?\n\nIs it the case that fielding a Muslim candidate makes one secular? Is it better if they pick a Muslim like Mohsin Raza to represent Muslims or field a Muslim who had no chance of winning when one party had given 100 tickets and the other party had given 80 tickets to Muslims. The votes were already divided and you have convinced Muslims that BJP is an anti-Muslim party. When the BJP fielded Shahnawaz Hussain in Bihar, the Muslim leaders told the community to vote against him, against the BJP.\n\nThe chief minister says that he is a Hindu and has no reason to celebrate Eid, he runs down the Mughal emperor Akbar, and he refused to cover his head when he visited in the Kabir mazar. Do none of those things bother you?\n\nNo, it does not. This issue started from Gujarat when Modi ji refused to wear a topi by Muslim religious leaders, but did he not wear the shawl that was given to him? Islam mein daadi hai, daadi mein Islam nahin hai (there is a beard in Islam, not Islam in a beard). Modi ji keeps a daadi, but no one appreciates it. If he was anti-Muslim or anti-Islam, as the so called secular parties make him out to be, he would have shaved off the daadi.\n\nWhy did you take a topi for Yogi ji, you should have taken a taj (crown). It would be a way of saying,'you have come here, we welcome you with a mukut.' Muslim badshahs have worn crowns. They could have taken a nice crown for him. We would have thought, they have opened their hearts and taken a crown for Yogi ji as an appreciation for his good work. Why did they take a topi?\n\nThe CM, in a state with a significant Muslim population, says that he is a proud Hindu who does not celebrate Eid.\n\nYogi ji is also a priest, a dharmic guru. The way we (Muslims) have dharmic gurus, and we respect them, he is a guru, he is a maharaj. He said that as a Hindu, he doesn't celebrate Eid, but as a chief minister, he respects those who do and gives them protection. All the ministers and the administration came to my house for Eid. Yogi ji sent a letter because he was not in town. I can give you a copy.\n\nWhy this talk of Akbar not being great?\n\nPeople can take out different issues on which to criticize him, but the reality is that Yogi ji is working honestly in Uttar Pradesh. The way that he is hammering on law and order. Crime is going towards zero tolerance.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sent a notice to the UP government over encounter killings in the state. There is also concern that the government has targeted Muslims in these operations.\n\nThere is nothing like that. It is simply propaganda because the 2019 election is drawing near. They have no other issue. They cannot accuse us of corruption either in the state government or the central government. They have no agenda of their own. They will resort to communal and caste-ist politics. The Opposition has nothing. The Opposition does not have a single candidate that can run this country. We have formed the government in 21 states. Have we done it on the basis of communalism? No, we have done it on the basis of development, sabka saath, sabka vikas, on trust and on hope.\n\nThe BJP campaigned on the issue of Love Jihad in western UP in the Assembly election.\n\nLove Jihad was not an issue for the BJP. We only said that illegal slaughterhouses will not be allowed to operate. We have 11 crore members and if someone says something, then the media and the Opposition makes hell for the party. No one will care what Owaisi (Asaduddin Owaisi) has said or what Azam Khan has said, but what a BJP worker had said that becomes a huge issue.\n\n(During the 2017 election campaign, Adityanath said that Love Jihad would dominate the poll. The CM, while speaking in Kerala in October 2017, said, \"Love Jihad is a dangerous thing...\").\n\nWhy was the Haj house painted saffron by the BJP government?\n\nIt was the office of the Haj committee, not the Haj house. No minister gave such an order. The government officials did it. It is not a religious building. We didn't put saffron colours on a mosque. The Haj committee office comes under the government of UP.\n\nTo paint a government office saffron...\n\nIf you are talking about bhagwa, I'm tired of answering this question since January. Do you see bhagwa only as a colour of Hindutva? People will have to expand their minds. When you wake up in the morning, it is bhagwa that brings the world into light. Have you complained to god about why the colour of the sky is bhagwa? If even for one day our world does not start with bhagwa then there will be chaos in the world. People will go mad. It is the colour of god, it is the gift of god. Who are these people who are after saffron?\n\nYou don't believe there is growing intolerance since the BJP has come to power. The murder of Junaid Khan in a train, last year, the hateful messages doing the rounds on social media?\n\nYou are talking about intolerance. What about \"tukde honge...bharat tere tukde honge.\" Where were these slogans raised and who are the political leaders that went in support of it. Did Rahul Gandhi ji go or not? Is this the kind of thinking that one should have? Is this not intolerance? Do they really think that they have flown the flag of secularism?\n\nLeaving politics aside, you must be concerned about the religious intolerance, the cow vigilantism?\n\nHave you read about Pakistan....\n\nWe are not Pakistan.\n\nMuslims in India live with such freedom that they can burn an effigy of the president and the prime minister on the streets if they want. Can they do it in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia?\n\nThose countries are not the world's largest democracy.\n\nBut what do you want in the name of democracy. You have the freedom to say what you want, through the media, on the roads, on a mike. Why are you feeling so nervous? Only because the BJP is a principled party, a nationalist party, and it is thinking about the country as a whole, and not just your selfish agenda?\n\nHow do you explain the lynching of Muslims by cow vigilantes, prevalent under the BJP?\n\nThis is a political issue. The Opposition cannot find anything against us so they have to find something. Perhaps they have volunteers who are getting it done.\n\nMohammad Ikhlaq in Dadri and Qasim in Harpur were lynched by Hindu villagers. Have you seen the video of Qasim...\n\nI have seen the videos. These videos go viral, but I believe that 90 percent are fake.\n\nThe police of UP government, your government, has arrested two Hindu villagers in connection with Qasim's lynching.\n\nThings there are divided between political parties. There is a political agenda. Such things are done on purpose. We all know who was behind the Muzaffarnagar riots. What happened in 2013 and what was the result in 2014. Did we do that? Who was exposed?\n\nWhat has the Adityanath government done for minorities?\n\nAround \u20b94,000 crore has been allocated for minority welfare in the budget, this year. It has never happened before. Why have we given an extra 400 crores in education to them? We have to educate them and connect them with the mainstream. Muslims have benefitted from the Ujjwala Yojna (which provides free gas connections to poor families).\n\n[The BJP government allocated \u20b92,757 crore for minority welfare in the 2018 budget for UP (the third highest allocation since 2010) and \u20b9404 crore for the modernization of madrasas. After reducing the allocation by almost 19 percent in 2017-2018, it was increased by 11 percent in 2018-2019, the year leading up to the general election].\n\nAlso on HuffPost India:"

The design guru appeared Sunday on a Lyft-sponsored Pride parade float, where he oversaw the nuptials of Andrew Pharis and Guillermo Irias, Toni Botticelli and Melissa Ricker, and Shakarah Dean and Angelina Bowkett. Lyft reportedly pre-selected the three couples, all of whom hailed from New York, but didn\u2019t introduce them to Berk before the June 24 event in an effort to maintain the surprise.\n\nKelly Balch Berk (rear) officiated the wedding of Andrew Pharis and Guillermo Irias during the New York Pride parade on Sunday.\n\nBerk told People he \u201cjumped right onto the float\u201d when Lyft approached him about the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s always been something that I thought would be very special to do,\u201d he said. In a separate interview with Out magazine, he added, \u201cI thought this was a great way to give back to our community ... These three couples getting married, with tens of thousands of their \u2018chosen family\u2019 of witnesses is beautiful.\u201d\n\nKelly Balch Berk (with Toni Botticelli and Melissa Ricker) said he sees LGBTQ couples' right to marry as \u201cone of the things I have the most pride of in the world.\u201d\n\nBerk\u2019s own wedding was not quite as public as the three couples\u2019 celebrations. He tied the knot with his now-husband, Dewey, in an intimate ceremony officiated by a close friend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for 14 years, we\u2019ve been married for six; as soon as it became legal to get married, we got married, so he was pretty confident that I\u2019d say yes,\u201d Berk told People. \u201cPersonally, I loved that we had a friend do our marriage because I absolutely wouldn\u2019t have wanted somebody from a religious organization performing my wedding, nor would I have wanted it in a religious dwelling. I love the fact that we\u2019re able to marry these couples on a float on the most accepting and inclusive day in the freaking world.\u201d Berk said he sees LGBTQ couples\u2019 right to marry as \u201cone of the things I have the most pride of in the world.\u201d\n\nKelly Balch \u201cThese three couples getting married, with tens of thousands of their \u2018chosen family\u2019 of witnesses is beautiful,\" said Berk (with Shakarah Dean and Angelina Bowkett)."

After the government signed a treaty with Russia to build two new blocks of a nuclear power plant, the dependence of the country's electric energy production rose to almost 80 percent.\n\n\u201cHungary has shifted to closer cooperation with Russia than the EU,\u201d J\u00e1vor said. There was no evidence that Hungary\u2019s stance was directly aimed at helping Russia export gas to Europe, Javor conceded, but \u201cwe can see that they go hand in hand,\u201d he added. \u201cAny energy efficiency program on an EU scale would decrease gas consumption and have dramatic costs for Russian imports,\u201d the MEP added. Earlier this month, the Bulgarian parliament voted to resurrect the Soviet-era Belene nuclear plant, mothballed in 2012 because of concerns about its cost, necessity and safety, and under pressure from the United States and Europe to reduce its energy dependence on Russia (which had been slated to build the plant). Rosatom, Russia\u2019s state-owned nuclear company, has expressed interest in the revived plant. \u201cThat nuclear power plant does not have any energy or economic justification whatsoever,\u201d said Julian Popov, a former Bulgarian environment minister. \u201cNot one single energy expert will say it is a good idea. I am not against nuclear power as a technology, but Belene is a disaster case.\u201d Like Hungary, Bulgaria has resisted ambitious climate targets in Brussels (Neno Dimov, the country\u2019s environment minister, also has alleged neo-Nazi connections and has described global warming as \u201ca hoax\u201d.) The country has used its EU presidency this year to try to replace the EU\u2019s \u201cenergy efficiency first\u201d principle with a rule that member states cannot promote energy efficiency projects over gas infrastructure projects. Far more important than climate concerns in Bulgaria, experts say, is the country\u2019s dream of becoming an entry point for Russian gas supplies piped through Turkey, which is headed by another authoritarian leader. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Bulgarian cabinet minister said that the country\u2019s energy ministry was simply not engaged with environmental concerns. \u201cGas infrastructure is very important for us right now,\u201d the official told HuffPost. \u201cWe want to become a Balkan gas hub. It is a priority for us. To be frank, the benefits of energy efficiency are not universally understood in the Bulgarian government. It is very difficult to convince the finance ministry.\u201d Russia\u2019s energy agenda plays to a wider audience than extreme nationalists. Gas and nuclear are both seen as relatively lower carbon options than coal, which could \u201cbridge\u201d the path to a mid-century world powered solely by renewables. However, some climate studies suggest that, where gas is concerned, the bridge could also burn the chances of limiting global warming to no more than a 2 C temperature rise above pre-Industrial levels \u2015 the target the majority of scientists say cannot be exceeded if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Several academic papers have found that investment in gas could crowd out desperately needed funds for renewable energy while providing few emissions-cutting benefits. Denmark, Portugal and Germany are already achieving 100 percent renewable electricity cover for short periods. And a push by the European Parliament earlier this month for a net zero emissions target by 2050 gained surprising traction, even if the same blocking countries prevented its uptake. But environmentalists\u2019 hopes that Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel would stand up for clean energy ambition were dashed when her energy minister, Peter Altmaier, ruled out \u201cunachievable\u201d higher targets for 2030. The German government is struggling to meet its own climate targets for 2020 \u2013 and to pacify rising anti-migrant sentiment within its borders, and beyond. Germany also expects to begin importing Russian gas through a giant pipeline \u2013 Nord Stream 2 \u2013 in 2019, and this is sparking accusations that EU legislation has been spiked to please Moscow.\n\nCarsten Koall via Getty Images A worker stands in front of pipes which lie stacked at the Nord Stream 2 facility on Ruegen Island, Germany, in October 2017.\n\nClaude Turmes, Luxembourg\u2019s new energy minister, told HuffPost he believes that Putin is using his contacts with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Merkel in Germany to derail a proposed revision to an EU gas directive, which aims to increase transparency, competition and energy security. \u201cWe have to take that [Russian threat] extremely seriously,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are in a really dangerous moment.\u201d One European government, though, has apparently bucked the trend of populist indifference to global warming. Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement (M5S) emerged as the largest party in recent elections and bagged the environmental portfolio in a new coalition government. As well as arguing for ambitious clean energy targets in the recent Brussels haggle, M5S has launched a review into the vast southern gas pipeline that would take gas from Azerbaijan to Western Europe and so reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian gas. Italy\u2019s new environment minister has described the 1,850-kilometer project as \u201cpointless.\u201d But much as the review will be welcomed by environmental campaigners, it is also music to the ears of those in the Kremlin, which fears its stranglehold on Europe\u2019s gas market being undermined. Both M5S and its coalition partner, the far-right League, are close to Russia \u2013 with whom the League has signed a cooperation pact \u2013 and the new administration is pushing for an end to EU sanctions against Russia. Russian nuclear interests may also be seeing a revival of fortune in the Czech Republic. The billionaire populist Andrej Babi\u0161, who won recent elections on an anti-migrant platform, is in the process of forming a government with the country\u2019s pro-Moscow Communist Party.\n\nDavid W Cerny / Reuters Andrej Babi\u0161 waiting to be appointed as Czech prime minister on June 6, 2018."

That\u2019s the premise of Story Time from Space, a project from the nonprofit Global Space Education Foundation that features astronauts reading beloved children\u2019s books from the International Space Station.\n\nT2 Science & Math Education Story Time from Space is a project that features astronauts reading children's books from the International Space Station.\n\nPatricia Tribe, the former director of education at Space Center Houston who came up with the basis for the project, told HuffPost that the thought of merging space and reading came up after she did some research on literacy and science skills in the United States. She decided to merge STEM and literacy in a way that\u2019s easily accessible for kids. \u201cWhat better role models to engage kids in science and to engage them in reading?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not only looking and listening to the books, you\u2019re looking around the International Space Station.\u201d Story Time from Space began with a pilot test from astronaut Benjamin Alvin Drew Jr., also known as Alvin Drew, who helped co-found the initiative with Tribe. He read Max Goes to the Moon, a book by astrophysicist and author Jeffrey Bennett, on the final flight of the space shuttle Discovery. Since the project\u2019s official launch, other stories that have been told from space include Next Time You See a Sunset by Emily Morgan and Rosie Revere, Engineer by Andrea Beaty. The footage of the reading sessions are available on the Story Time from Space site and YouTube. Watch astronaut Kate Rubins read Rosie Revere, Engineer below.\n\nThe Story Time from Space team, which includes astronauts, scientists, educators and others, has important guidelines when it comes to choosing the books. They have to be \u201cneat\u201d books that can be read in about 15 minutes, involve some sort of concept regarding STEM and, most important, be accurate. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to perpetuate any misinformation,\u201d Tribe said. The team members sometimes receive books from authors who want to be considered for the reading sessions. They also keep up with various lists and recommendations involving STEM-focused children\u2019s books. When they have a group of books to consider, the team discusses why a title should or shouldn\u2019t be part of a launch. One thing the team keeps in mind is having books that cover a wide range of age groups.\n\nT2 Science & Math Education The selected books include Jeffrey Bennett's work about a dog named Max who loves space, among many other titles."

Het spijt me!\u201d That\u2019s Flemish for \u201cWhoops! I am very sorry!\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg reiterated what\u2019s become a common refrain, acknowledging both that his company failed to properly safeguard its users\u2019 data and that it was caught unprepared to counteract political meddling during past elections. As he\u2019s done before, he assured the European politicians that Facebook now takes both issues seriously, but he stopped short of promising they won\u2019t arise again.\n\nZuckerberg was originally scheduled to speak privately, but agreed to have the questioning streamed online under pressure from European Parliament President Antonio Tajani.\n\nSome of the sharpest queries came from Belgian member Guy Verhofstadt, who called out Zuckerberg for Facebook\u2019s long history of apologizing for its mistakes and then failing to actually correct them. He noted the similarities between Facebook and the global banking system, which assured watchdogs in 2006 that it was doing a great job of self-regulation. A historic global recession soon followed, set off by banking malfeasance.\n\n\u201cI really think we have a big problem here and it\u2019s not solved by saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to fix it ourselves,\u2019\u201d Verhofstadt said.\n\nThen he asked Zuckerberg directly if he wants to be remembered, together with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, as having \u201cenriched our world and societies\u201d or if he wants to simply be \u201cthe genius that created a digital monster that is destroying our democracies and our societies.\u201d\n\nThe meeting constituted Zuckerberg\u2019s sole address to European politicians ahead of the May 25 implementation date for strict new data privacy rules under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Zuckerberg declined an invitation to separately address lawmakers in the U.K., where Facebook is under fire for its role in the country\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\nUnlike his testimony in the U.S., where members of Congress took turns questioning Zuckerberg and hearing his answers, the European politicians all spoke first and then Zuckerberg addressed their questions in one long statement at the end. That format proved problematic, as several members objected when he ignored the specifics and stuck to discussing their \u201chigh level\u201d concerns.\n\nPressed for greater detail toward the end, including on the company\u2019s practice of tracking people who don\u2019t even have Facebook profiles, Zuckerberg promised to \u201cfollow up\u201d with the politicians at a later date."

And when you finally get your period, all you can think about is getting into your PJs and eating more comfort food.\n\nFor most women, these sudden changes in appetite and mood are normal, something we listen and adapt to. But why do we feel more hungry around our period, really?\n\nWe automatically think it has everything to do with hormones, but it's actually much more than that.\n\n\"There's certainly some evidence that women do get hungrier and crave sugar and sweet things, primarily chocolate, leading up to their period in the premenstrual or luteal phase of their cycle,\" Dr Clare Ballingall, a GP and chair of RACGP Tasmania, told The Huffington Post Australia.\n\nThere are many theories as to why this happens, Ballingall said.\n\nGetty\n\n\"We do know the hormone changes that occur, so oestrogen and progesterone go up and then they drop off just before the period, and this is a theory for increased hunger,\" Ballingall explained.\n\n\"The other thing is we know that women possibly become a bit more responsive to insulin in that premenstrual phase. Some women can experience mild alterations in their blood sugar and cravings for chocolate, that's a possible theory.\n\n\"Women also often get irritable and cranky premenstrually, and there's a theory that somehow eating chocolate increases serotonin and dopamine, which are involved with helping 'prop up' mood.\"\n\nNutritionist Pip Reed agrees, saying that the occurrence of PMS or PMT symptoms can lead us to reach for foods which boost our energy and mood.\n\n\"Often this hunger is for more carb and sugar heavy foods as we may find the rise in oestrogen increases PMS symptoms, including irritability, stress, anxiety. So we're therefore looking for foods that will give us a quick energy boost,\" Reed told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"Interestingly, the main paper I looked at, which had the most women involved in, there was no increase in cravings for salt and fast food in that same period. Women eat more leading up to that period, and they sleep less, which is interesting,\" Ballingall added.\n\nDebra Bardowicks Cuddle up with your doggo and be kind to yourself.\n\nBeyond physiological reasons for increased hunger around menstruation, Ballingall also said there are psychological and cultural factors at play here.\n\n\"Psychology Today theorised that culturally we've reinforced chocolate as being a way to deal with stress, through media and subliminal advertising,\" Ballingall said.\n\n\"They suggested that in a society we, as women, are told to avoid fat and sugar, and that we're all guilted into having this certain body type image and we must maintain that.\n\n\"But somehow it's culturally acceptable for one time a month to just let yourself go and reward yourself with chocolate as you're feeling a bit crap because it's your period. Culturally we accept that, where any other time of the month it's unacceptable to binge on chocolate.\"\n\nThere's also the fact that treating ourselves to chocolate, getting in our comfies and cosying up in bed with a feel-good movie, really does make us feel good. We're allowing ourselves to relax and indulge in foods we often ban or restrict ourselves of.\n\n\"Absolutely. Chocolate makes you feel good, that's a proven thing. That melting feeling in your mouth, the sugar hit, the energy hit,\" Ballingall said.\n\nGiven that women make up around 50 percent of the world's population, there is surprisingly little scientific research into women's health issues surrounding the menstrual cycle.\n\n\"There's not actually a lot of journal work done around this area suggesting why this happens, which I think is remarkable,\" Ballingall said.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Gentle exercise can help reduce PMS and PMT.\n\nIf you are experiencing PMS symptoms and increased hunger and food cravings, try these four tips.\n\n1. Be kind to yourself\n\nIf you're feeling low, moody and hungry, instead of resenting yourself for it, be kind to yourself.\n\n\"I have a lot of women who get really bad PMT. There's lots of issues dealing with that,\" Ballingall said.\n\n\"I reinforce that cultural message of: don't beat yourself up about it because there's a lot of things women feel guilty about anyway.\"\n\nIf chocolate and ice cream is what you want and they make you feel better, then have them in appropriate amounts.\n\n\"Everything in moderation is fine. To calorie restrict on your premenstrual phase is a miserable thing to do,\" Ballingall said.\n\n\"Just generally be kind to yourself more than anything. There's still this 'periods are bad', 'periods are taboo' and 'periods are somehow getting rid of the toxins', and people still believe all that. Try to normalise it as much as possible.\"\n\nGetty Images Do things that make YOU feel good.\n\n2. Do gentle exercise and eat well\n\nAlong with that delicious chocolate, try to do gentle exercise like walking or yoga, and remember that eating healthily will actually make you feel better.\n\n\"I spend a lot of time talking to women about eating well and doing a bit of exercise, especially in the premenstrual period,\" Ballingall said.\n\n\"For those who want the treat but still want to eat healthy, choose high fibre natural foods such as dates and walnuts, raw nut treats like caramel slice, and add cinnamon to breakfast and afternoon yoghurt snacks for blood sugar stabilisation,\" Reed told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"Choose dark chocolate varieties over milk for antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Pana Chocolate or Loving Earth are made with coconut nectar and taste amazing.\"\n\nFocus on choosing whole grain versions of refined pastas, breads and snacks.\n\n\"[Choose] whole grain versions such as quinoa, sourdough, rye, amaranth or buckwheat instead which contain more nutrients, are high fibre and won't cause blood sugar spikes,\" Reed said.\n\n\"Also make sure you have good healthy fats and protein such as avocado, nuts, seeds, fish and chia seeds to fill you up and decrease inflammation.\"\n\nTHE 5TH Make sure you fill up on whole foods (and lots of tea).\n\n3. See a GP\n\nIf your PMS or PMT symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life, including your concentration or your mood to the point where you feel depressed, see your GP for help.\n\n\"A lot of women get really bad PMT. Looking at their mood, we sometimes offer a cyclical antidepressant where some women take them in the two weeks leading up to their period and then stop,\" Ballingall said.\n\n\"That's accepted treatment now for people who have true PMT which is interfering with their lives.\"\n\n4. Don't compare yourself to other women\n\nThe worst thing you can do is compare yourself to that other woman who doesn't get PMS or the friend who glides through their period without any weight gain, increased hunger or pain.\n\n\"That's where our job is hard -- there's no one size fits all,\" Ballingall said. \"My endeavour every day is for them to take on one simple healthy eating and lifestyle tip, whether it's on their period or not. But also to be kind to themselves.\"\n\nClick below to follow HuffPost Australia on Snapchat!"

This is a story about the best fast food fried chicken.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not going to be the best you\u2019ve ever had, when you need a quick fix around various parts of the country, this fried chicken will be there for you.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, I ate fried chicken from five chains that do it well \u2015 Church\u2019s Chicken, Popeye\u2019s, Shake Shack, Chick-fil-A and KFC \u2015 and ranked them. I selected these chains in particular because they\u2019re in most areas of the country (sorry, regional chains like Bojangles).\n\nWhy did I include outliers like Shake Shack and Chick-fil-A, even though they don\u2019t make traditional fried chicken? First of all, they might not offer chicken as part of a two-piece meal, but they do serve fried chicken, which makes them eligible. And secondly, I judged their chicken on its own merit and not the sandwich as a whole. I didn\u2019t want certain elements of the sandwich like a fantastic bun (hello, Chick-fil-A!) to distract from the main event: the chicken. And this is all about the fried chicken.\n\nIf you think that\u2019s unfair or stupid, you\u2019ve probably not read this sentence, and have already skipped to writing about how unfair and stupid this article is in the comments.\n\nHere is America\u2019s best (fast food) fried chicken, from good to great."

APCSOC will carry out regular audits of all departments' websites, and is also about to launch a website to educate individuals and organisations about the importance of security. The same site can also be used to report incidents - individuals can report incidents they find, while organisations can bring up their security issues, which APCSOC will try and offer assistance with.\n\nThe APCSOC was inaugurated in April, and from May, it began the process of security auditing the government departments' online presence. \"Security is one issue. Privacy is another, and it is important and pertinent,\" said V Premchand Managing Director of Andhra Pradesh Technology Services, which oversees cyber security issues in the AP government, and is the authority running APCSOC.\n\n\"We started doing security audits in May, and it has been a very time consuming process,\" he added. \"The different departments have their own systems and a lot of the decisions on security have so far been taking place on an ad hoc basis, so one of the first tasks for us was to establish the SOP (standard operating procedure) to be followed. We are now going to do this for privacy along with security.\"\n\nHowever, it's up to the departments to determine what constitutes a breach of privacy. \"We are not going to define privacy, we are a technological agency,\" he said. \"What we can do is tell the department, 'hey, this data is available,' and then they can determine whether that is intentional or not.\"\n\nSources in the government showed what the APCRT would look like once live, with sections showing the latest security news updates, and advisories for the general public on how to secure their gadgets, aside from a page to report cyber security issues with different options for government agencies, organisations, and individuals to make their reports."

Not shirtless dudes with a bow tie. Like a real Gatsby party with everyone fully dressed like the era.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a party guy but I\u2019d be down if someone threw a real roaring 20\u2019s party for 2020. Like real tuxedos and all. Not shirtless dudes with a bow tie. Like a real Gatsby party with everyone fully dressed like the era.\n\nWhich, OK, sure. It\u2019s a fairly benign tweet as far as tweets go, and it\u2019s easy to imagine scrolling past it in your feed, puzzling for a moment over \u201cshirtless dudes with a bow tie\u201d and then immediately moving on with your life. Except, at the time of publication, this unexceptional tweet has been retweeted over 83,000 times and faved nearly 330,000 times.\n\n4) tbh its a short book which ik we can all read to feel good about ourselves n then feel good for liking n then self masturbatory whatever\n\n2) with regards to the shirtless guys n tuxedos bit i have zero fuckin clue,, ive literally never been to a proper party but i guess thats a thing? that they need to distinguish between trash faux fancy and their very smart\u2122 cool gatsby part\n\n1) its kinda like just appealing to a broad aesthetic of gatsby,,, which i feel either enough teens have heard about enough n wanna reference or have seen the baz lurhman version and are very into so we\u2019re like fuck yes! leo! lana! being this shit on!\n\nBased on the replies, the tweet appears to be resonating most with teens or, at the very least, people who were very recently teens. Clearly, I had to find some teens . I convened an ad hoc panel of extremely online teens and put the question to them.\n\nI never heard from him again.\n\nAnother teen, Enzo, was slightly more helpful:\n\nThis tweet is complex, but it boils down to nostalgia and cultural illiteracy. This tweet really invokes posts (often popular with white teens) longing for iconic and nostalgic imagery of the past, like those from a couple years back wishing for an era of 1950\u2019s diners with milkshakes. It is often pointed out by those who respond that nothing is preventing those desiring this imagery from going to a fifties themed diner in 2018. The cultural illiteracy aspect comes in when the actual book referenced, Gatsby, is invoked, whose premise is that these lavish parties only left Jay Gatsby with pain and emptiness. The teens who retweeted it are truly only interested in The Aesthetic\u2122 of the era, ironically missing Fitzgerald\u2019s point. Racial inequality is indisputable in many of these desired eras, and questions are raised by responders if the white teens are consciously or subconsciously longing for an era of POC exclusion. Further, the distancing from typical party scenes, as seen in the statement \u201cNot shirtless dudes with a bow tie.\u201d bears strong resemblance to the \u201cI\u2019m not like the other girls\u201d aesthetic.\n\nMichael, too, began to shed some light on things:\n\nHonestly I think the tweet might be genuinely popular. Having a roaring 20s party strikes me as the kind of idea that is different enough for bougie high schoolers to feel like they\u2019re doing something unqiue, diverse or intellectually respectable - even though it really isn\u2019t any of those things and it\u2019s just an excuse to be smugly superior and possibly express problematic racial sentiments while still partying. It reminds me of when there was a whole thing being made about wearing sagging pants and a lot of the upper class kids I knew made a big deal of liking to wear nice clothes and what not, it was sort of like this weird act to show superiorority, and the problematic racial politics of the whole thing were very evident (the same applies for this tweet, as well).\n\nShannon C said:\n\nI believe us Gen Z\u2019ers are the generation that says \u201c I was born in the ~wrong generation~\u201d, then disregards all of the horrible things that happens because THOSE FLAPPER DRESSES!\n\nDissertating furiously, a perceptive teen named John saw a dialectic at work:\n\ni think one set of people literally just thinks it\u2019d be cool to have a gatsby party in 2020 and they\u2019re rting it to \u201csuggest\u201d it to their friends (kind of like those people who tag their friends in really elaborate instagram food videos, knowing full well they\u2019re not gonna make/buy the thing). like most of the replies i saw when i clicked on it just now are \u201clmao we should totally do this\u201d then there\u2019s a second group of people rting it to hot take about it. see for people who were 18 or younger in 2013 when the leo great gatsby movie came out, gatsby was really ~relevant~ and ~cultural~ because it was this Great Novel we were all reading in middle school or high school and a movie with a famous guy was coming out, right? and if you were an insufferable white teenager, you could pretend to be all ~literary~ for going to the movie. and we all felt very insightful for understanding that gatsby is Critiquing the roaring twenties upper class and not glamorizing it. and if you were Moderately Online in those days, people such as this would sometimes post about how gatsby was such a cool movie, and how maybe they should have a gatsby themed party, and you and your insufferable friends would Own the non-literary people for not understanding that the ~roaring twenties aesthetic~ isn\u2019t supposed to be cool or glamorous in the novel, it\u2019s supposed to be this manifestation of a shitty and greedy upper class, ya feel. and i\u2019ve seen a couple hot take-y quotes of this tweet saying \u201cbuhhh you don\u2019t GET it gatsby is supposed to be a CRITIQUE so that means YOU CAN\u2019T HAVE ANY FUN ABOUT IT.\u201d obviously now is an era in american society when getting starry eyed abt the upper class is that much more weird and uncomfortable. but the people rting this are doing it less to call out the glamorization of the shitty predatory capitalism of the 1920s and more to feel smart and get a Twitter Own because they, unlike you, know that gatsby is a critique. because that\u2019s what they did in 2013 and they felt cool for doing it at the time and so my theory about this twete (which could be wrong) is that it blew up because 50% of people really want to have a gatsby party, and 50% really want to be know-it-alls and Own the first 50% by telling them about the Actual Significance Of The Novel. because that\u2019s exactly what they did back in 2013, when knowing that gatsby was a Critique made you feel intelligent (because again, we were all insufferable pre-to-mid-teens and didn\u2019t know any better). and the one group magnifies the other and vice versa\n\nOne theme that came up repeatedly is what our teen critics referred to as \u201clocal Twitter.\u201d Local Twitter is a little hard to explain; it isn\u2019t a literal designation so much as a vibe \u2014 not the state of being a townie but its essence. Here\u2019s how Daniel puts it:\n\nShit like this is representative of an adaptation of the broad phenomenon known as local twitter, coined to represent those people in a teen\u2019s hometown with little ambition and expectation. Common groups in this category are traditional family type conservatives as well as your local marijuana focused community. Anyway, this represent neither of these camps but derives its popularity in a similar way. Its scope expands due to some weird relatability among people who only recognize the extravagance and aesthetic of gatsby and the time period. This is a deviation from the norm, represented by the shirtless dudes part, which only really refers to a perceived comparative lack of classiness of frat-descendent party culture. You may have heard of people planning random fancy dinner parties to achieve the same effect. The other reason for it\u2019s scope is that along with probably one or two \u201clocal\u201d posts every couple of days, this post has been quite-tweeted and roasted. That quite-tweet quite possible reaches into the 100k likes region itself. I\u2019m afraid there is no particularly online answer or reference here.\n\nLiza, too, partially blamed local Twitter for the tweet\u2019s bizarre rise:\n\nOk so I first saw this tweet in the context of someone making fun of it, which I agreed with. I think the original tweet is stupid, since the point of the whole novel is to exhibit the superficiality of extreme wealth and those who possess it, but I get why it blew up. A lot of people my age (not to sound like I am some uniquely sophisticated teen who is above such stupidity) are really enamoured with the surface level aesthetics of Gatsby \u2014 for instance, Gatsby themed parties where everyone dresses up in flapper dresses and suits are super common. I think a huge part of it was that film adaptation with Leonardo diCaprio that came out in like 2013. Coupled with that, those kind of aspirational tweets are really popular on what is called \u201clocal twitter\u201d (i.e. basic people). I\u2019ll see tweets all the time that are just like \u201cI want someone who I can just eat chicken nuggets and listen to Drake with while we drive to Target\u201d that get like 100k retweets, so I think it\u2019s an offshoot of that. Hope this helped (and yeah, if you use this, you can just quote me as Liza, if that works).\n\nFrom Hayden:\n\nOk, so I have a lot of thoughts on this, and my friend DP weighed in as well. So we think there are several reasons it blew up. One section of the retweets are just be people who agree. For the most part, though, we think it\u2019s criticism, and there are two main points. Some people are angry that that\u2019s all this guy took away from The Great Gatsby (one snarky response pointed out that the book ends badly), but most people are reacting poorly to the \u201cI wish it was the 20\u2019s\u201d sentiment that they think the tweet is evoking. There used to be a ton of posts floating around the internet like \u201cWish it was the fifties \ud83d\ude0d\u201d with pictures of milkshakes and what have you until people remembered racism and misogyny, so now everyone reacts quickly to \u201canother era\u201d type posts. We think the tweet first blew up because of the group who agreed, and that\u2019s how it found its way to the people who stared criticizing the perceived romanticization of the twenties.\n\nSo, does all of this explain why this tweet delighted or irritated enough people to be retweeted 80,000 times? I guess, sort of, in a way. And is this a reminder that we are very old and every day inching closer toward death? Undoubtedly, yes.\n\nI decided to ask Karter, the tweeter himself, about his sudden viral fame. He seemed as at a loss as anyone:"

This means an exponential increase in the quantum of confidential data flowing between government departments, and private parties \u2014 raising the repercussions of future privacy breaches in every Indian state.\n\n\"Medications indicate the possible conditions a person or someone in their family may have,\" said Pam Dixon, founder and executive director of the World Privacy Forum. \"This information can be especially sensitive when employers gain access, or even just neighbours who learn of a sensitive condition.\"\n\nMedical conditions like AIDS and depression continue to carry a stigma in India; publishing such data, Dixon noted, could cause real harm.\n\n\"People who are discovered by employers to have serious medical conditions can be fired, children can be treated unfairly in school due to a past or current medical condition,\" Dixon said. \"People have quite literally been stalked and harmed as a direct result of inappropriate personal information disclosure.\"\n\nHuffPost Staff\n\nLeaky Pradesh\n\nThis is not the first time the Andhra Pradesh government has unwittingly exposed its residents by publishing their intimate details online.\n\nIn April this year, Huffington Post revealed that it's possible to geolocate people in Andhra Pradesh by caste or religion down to their doorstep, allowing for the targeting of every minority family, in a state that has witnessed outbreaks of communal violence.\n\n\"This is an important issue because it is not the first time that something like this is happening in Andhra Pradesh,\" said Kodali, the researcher who first spotted both leaks. \"But no one is held accountable for the loss of privacy for citizens.\"\n\nKodali said he wrote to the authorities when he discovered the vulnerabilities, but did not hear back from them.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty, the agency responsible for the Anna Sanjivini programme, but they did not respond.\n\nHuffPost also reached out to the Chief Minister's Office Realtime Executive (CORE), whose dashboard leads to Anna Sanjivini. They locked down access to the site, but did not respond to HuffPost's questions.\n\n\"Governments do collect a lot of data. But it is rare for a government to also expose the data about its citizens in such an open fashion, as there are substantial risks of multiple types of harms associated with this kind of broad, identifiable data release,\" said Dixon, from the World Privacy Forum. \"There are many risks with collecting the data. But there are far more risks with exposing the data to anyone with an Internet connection.\"\n\nPrivate Interests\n\nWhile the Indian government drags its feet over drafting a robust data privacy law, private companies are already hoovering up personal information wherever they find it, even if they don't quite know what to use it for.\n\nFor instance, a database of phone numbers, linked to the medicines purchased by the holder of that number \u2014 of the sort published by AP \u2014 can easily be leveraged by medical insurance companies looking to snoop on their clients before they sell them insurance.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, the election commission website had leaked people's voter ID data,\" said a Bengaluru-based start-up entrepreneur speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"It was all just there district-wise as open PDF files.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if it would be useful, but I wrote a scraper to download all the voter IDs anyway, in case we could find a use later. I also did a few e-commerce campaigns where we bought people's data from brokers who had 'acquired' the data from IRCTC. I don't know how they got that, but I'm guessing someone junior somewhere probably put in a USB drive and just copied everything.\"\n\nHuffPost Staff\n\nThe Human Factor\n\n\"Whether it's a massive cybersecurity incident or small-scale one, about 80 percent of them point to having been caused by human error,\" said a representative from Kaspersky Lab, a multinational cybersecurity firm. \"Even with the most secure systems, the human element can lead to leaks. So we go back to the people, the employees.\"\n\n\"Educating the governmental staff on the motivations of security policies, the importance of working safely and how to contribute to the security of their organizations can help mitigate the risk of security incidents and safeguard what is truly important - their data,\" the Kaspersky representative said.\n\nKK Mookhey, the founder and CEO of Network Intelligence, a global cybersecurity company, agreed with this perspective.\n\n\"No system is fully secured and government systems don't necessarily have the highest security levels in place always,\" Mookhey said. \"There's always a chance that a highly motivated set of attackers can find their way around the best defences in the world.\""

This is the one, huh?\u201d Pfeiffer recalled Obama asking . When Pfeiffer replied yes, the president reportedly said that the \u201cadvice [he] gives everyone about marriage\u201d is to ask yourself three questions about your potential spouse.\n\nObama\u2019s former communications director Dan Pfeiffer describes receiving some excellent advice from the then-president in his new book, Yes We (Still) Can . Pfeiffer \u2015 now the co-host of Pod Save America \u2015 wrote that on his last day at the White House back in 2015, he was discussing his future plans to Obama and let it slip that he planned to move in with his then-girlfriend Howli Ledbetter.\n\nIf former President Barack Obama ever gets sick of the paid speaking circuit or signing deals to produce Netflix originals , he might want to give writing an advice column a shot.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s relationship advice to @danpfeiffer is better than 99% of the advice columns on the Internet. pic.twitter.com/AumDz0M8fY\n\n\u201cIs she someone you find interesting?\u201d Obama said, according to Pfeiffer. \u201cYou will spend more time with this person than anyone else for the rest of your life, and there is nothing more important than always wanting to hear what she has to say about things.\u201d\n\nQuestions one and two were just as weighty, though they required less explanation.\n\n\u201cDoes she make you laugh?\u201d Obama reportedly asked Pfeiffer.\n\nThen, the conversation turned to kids.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you want kids, but if you do, do you think she will be a good mom?\u201d Pfeiffer recalled the president asking. \u201cLife is long. These are the things that really matter over the long term.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Pfeiffer said he answered all the questions in the affirmative. (How awkward would that limo ride have been otherwise?)\n\n\u201cHowli is incredibly interesting and funnier than I am, and will be a phenomenal mom,\u201d Pfeiffer said he told the president.\n\n\u201cSounds like she\u2019s the one. Lucky you,\u201d Obama reportedly responded.\n\nPfeiffer and Ledbetter married in October 2016 \u2015 one of four weddings Pfeiffer said he attended that year of couples who had met while working for Obama.\n\n\u201cObama was always very proud of the hundreds of relationships that had sprung from his campaigns and his administration,\u201d Pfeiffer writes in the book.\n\nGiven that the former president and first lady celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in October, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better matchmaker."

The bill is meant to regulate the use of DNA for criminal investigation and justice delivery, and has provisions for the storage of genetic information. The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018 was passed in a cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and seeks to expand the use of DNA to help solve crimes, identify missing persons, and determine biological relationships between people. It will be introduced in Parliament during the Monsoon Session beginning July 18.\n\nAlthough the bill includes safeguards on how this data is meant to be used, it's worth pointing out that India still does not have any laws regarding data protection and privacy. The Justice BN Srikrishna Committee on data protection, which was formed in August 2017, was expected to present its report months ago, and there were strong leaks that it would come out in June. However, the report remains under wraps, and there there is no clarity about its recommendations. That's also only the first step, as it has to then be taken up by the government and made into a law.\n\nScientists who had helped draft the DNA Technology bill told The Telegraph that expanding the use of DNA in criminal investigations could lead to higher conviction rates, especially in cases of murder, rape or human trafficking, among other crimes involving the human body.\n\n\"We rely on DNA for two things - it helps establish beyond doubt the biological identity of an individual and it helps beyond doubt to determine whether there is any biological relationship between two persons,\" said Jayaraman Gowrishankar, former director and now an Indian National Science Academy senior scientist at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in Hyderabad.\n\nAccording to NDTV, there is also a provision for a jail term of up to three years for anyone who leaks information from one of the DNA databases being created, along with a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. People seeking this information through illegal means face the same punishment.\n\nIn other countries, DNA profiles are also used for a number of businesses such as health care, ancestry information, and even DNA-based custom diet plans. However, the draft DNA bill states that the data collected can only be used for the identification of a person, and not other uses.\n\nHowever, the accuracy of DNA testing in crime scenes has also been called into question over time. The possibility of cross contamination is incredibly high, and has led to innocent people going to prison.\n\nWriting on the subject for The Hindustan Times, Elonnai Hickok, Director, Internet Governance at the Centre for Internet and Society added: \"Policy needs to evolve past protections that are limited to process oriented legal privacy provisions, but instead to protections that are comprehensive \u2014 accounting for process and enabling the individual to control and know how her/ his data is being used and by whom. Other countries have recognised this and are taking important steps to empower the individual. India needs to do the same for its citizens.\""

The film has also resurrected Ranbir Kapoor's flailing box-office performance, bringing him back into the coveted 100-crore club that determines a star's equity in Bollywood.\n\nWhile the film is doing brisk business at the turnstiles, we need to acknowledge how deeply problematic it is. Hirani, master of emotional tearjerkers, uses his deft storytelling to weave a narrative that is excessively sympathetic towards Dutt, who happens to be his close friend and collaborator on the lucrative Munnabhai films.\n\nPrior to Sanju 's release, producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Hirani and Kapoor assured the media that the film wasn't an attempt to glorify or whitewash Dutt's crimes. Yet, the film's treatment and its companionable gaze paint Dutt as a victim and not the convict \u2014 that he was \u2014 under the Arms Act in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case.\n\nThe bias is established early in a scene where Dutt and his wife, Manyata (Dia Mirza), are on the lookout for a biographer to tell his side of the story. It is all downhill from there, as scene after scene makes clear that this is a Dutt-approved whitewash, rather than a clear-eyed appraisal of one of Bollywood's most enigmatic figures.\n\nThere's not a scene that looks at Dutt's life critically or with a sense of serious interrogation.\n\nWhile Hirani could have put Dutt's reckless actions in context, he chose to hold everyone \u2014 except for Sanjay Dutt \u2014 responsible for the star's plight.\n\nIn the film, Dutt becomes a drug addict because he was a gullible young man, crushed under the celebrity of his famous father, and who was led into the world of narcotics by a scheming peddler (a very over-the-top Jim Sarbh). He turns into a compulsive womaniser but that aspect is dealt with in a comedic manner, that minimises the extent of damage it caused to the women he wronged. He hid the AK 56 rifles because he was 'protecting' his family and got caught at the 'wrong time' and the media blew up the case.\n\nIn fact, the media-bashing is the most troubling part of the film where Hirani makes Dutt appear as if he was 'framed' by the media. The makers constantly deflect blame to insulate their leading man and what helps the film in pushing this warped narrative is that the leading man is really, really good at his job, as is a stellar supporting cast with Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt and Vicky Kaushal as Sanju's close friend. Kapoor immerses himself into the character and becomes Dutt, barring minor inconsistencies where his voice falters to sound more like Ranbir and less like the character.\n\nAt a time when newsrooms across the world are facing serious threats, and the establishment is determined to discredit the press, Hirani's decision to paint the media as the villain \u2014 going as far as including a song where Kapoor and Dutt literally trash newspapers \u2014 is deeply irresponsible.\n\nWhile the media may have misreported the trial, Dutt didn't go to jail because of said reports. He went to jail because he hid powerful weapons sourced from Abu Salem, a terrorist convicted in the 1993 Mumbai Blasts case.\n\nHirani also chooses to exclude relationships that are too difficult to gloss over. His sisters, Priya and Namrata, are practically voiceless and his difficult relationship with daughter Trishala or his ex-wives isn't even referenced to, as that wouldn't easily fit into the blameless-hero-narrative.\n\nDutt (in)famously said that his daughter, Trishala, had dreams of becoming an actor and he wanted \"to break her legs.\" None of those misogynistic, patriarchal remarks find mention in the film. The only time the film shows some self-awareness is when Dutt reads out a speech to his father where he says, \"You deserved a better son.\"\n\nThe unchecked privilege, the underlying victim syndrome, the consistent attempt to absolve Dutt of his actions, and then the media-blaming, make Sanju an ideal film for our post-truth times.\n\nA biography is great when it stares at the truth with an unflinching eye, not with a jaddu ki jhappi.\n\nAfter Sanju, let's hope we don't end up getting a Sallu.\n\nAlso see on HuffPost:"

We talk to people about what they eat, how they exercise and generally, what their healthy lifestyle is to maintain their weight now that they've lost it. You can read more stories from Lost It here.\n\nBy: Oscar Chavez, as told to Chloe Tejada\n\nOccupation: Managing Partner and Founder of Health With Results\n\nAge: 32\n\nCity: Sydney, Australia\n\nThe story:\n\nI grew up big. I was always told by my mum to eat everything that was on my plate \u2014 even though it was adult-sized portions. Food is delicious!\n\nThe weight gain crept up on me. I had a bad break up in high school and I turned to food for comfort. Then I continued to turn to food when I had a bad day at work, when I was bored, when I just wanted to feel something. I was in massive denial about my state of happiness and contentment with my life.\n\nI tried everything in the 10 years I spent yo-yo dieting: meal replacement shakes, low calorie diets, low fat, low carb, meals delivered to my door, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and Tony Ferguson. I was desperate to change, especially when I finally faced the scale and saw that I weighed 354 pounds. I had massively let myself down.\n\nThe final straw:\n\nI was sitting in the doctor's office for a routine checkup and he told me that my blood pressure was through the roof. He told me that if I didn't change my bad habits I wouldn't live to see my kids' kids. That was my big wake-up call.\n\nHe suggested I have lap-band surgery to control my weight, but the prospect of surgery and all the complications that come with it scared me. I didn't want to give power to my condition by accepting surgery. Something in me said I had to fight for this naturally.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe plan of attack:\n\nI started researching food, nutrition, exercise and the human body. What was it that my body actually needed?\n\nIt's easy to be duped by marketing tactics, like all the low fat, zero-calorie labels, but that only contributes to temporary weight loss, meaning that the yo-yo spiral continues. There is a huge difference between temporary weight loss and permanent weight loss.\n\nThe inspiration:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was one of my biggest fitness inspirations. I watched a video where he was passionately obsessed with lifting and how he learnt to embrace the pain. So I took his philosophies with me into the gym with each work out and I had to become a completely different person, from someone who was lazy and made excuses to someone who took control of his own destiny.\n\nA post shared by Oscar Chavez (@fattofitfoodiecoach) on Jan 29, 2018 at 4:31pm PST\n\nThe hardest adjustment:\n\nI remember sitting there, looking at my gigantic portion sizes which I needed to eat to lose weight. Every time I tried dieting it was salads and starving. Now I had to shift to eating lots of whole food \u2014 past the point of being full.\n\nI had an existential moment where the very thing that led to my self-destruction was the only thing that could save me. I remember barely being able to breathe to eat the portions required. That was a crazy moment for me.\n\nThe food element:\n\nI started eating whole foods and I stopped relying on fast foods or heavily processed meals. I stopped being lazy and used the mindset, \"I'd rather die of starvation than put food in my body that would kill me.\" I took accountability. I turned to tacos as my go-to meal when I was time poor and pre-cooked chicken from the supermarket with a corn tortilla, some lime juice and yogurt.\n\nMy mantra is, \"Eat more and exercise less\" but you have to focus on quality. You need to know how much you're fuelling your body, just like when you fill up your car with petrol and go on a road trip. If you don't monitor the metre, then the car breaks down.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nCheck out more inspiring people:\n\nInspiring Lifestyle Success Stories Inspiring Lifestyle Success Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 of 270 Share this slide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI cut out things like chocolate bars, candy, chips, and crackers. I also cut out processed foods because they are calorie dense without the nutritional value so your body stores most of it as fat. These foods also damage your ability for your brain to tell you that you are full.\n\nI still have a problem with some types of food \u2014 I can eat forever so I just avoid them. So while I eat healthy most of the time, I still enjoy things like pizza and ice cream because I've focused on building a strong metabolism.\n\nThe exercise element:\n\nI joined a gym and I remained consistent. I worked with a couple of personal trainers, but in my experience some trainers aren't educated on what a morbidly obese frame can and can't do.\n\nI ended up slipping two disks in my spine due to improper technique with deadlifts that was never corrected by this trainer. I'm living with chronic pain because of it, but it doesn't stop me from working out and working on my health.\n\nBefore I decided to get healthy, my fitness level was horrible! I'd be huffing and puffing just from a walk up the stairs! I'd try to breathe quietly so that no one could hear me. Poor health has a detrimental effect on the overall quality of life, so that's why I like spreading my message. Life is just so much better when you're healthy.\n\nCurrently, I do high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and weight training. I work out six days a week, for 20- to 45-minute workouts. It's always changing. You have to constantly push yourself outside of your comfort zone and get slightly better every week.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe day-to-day:\n\nCurrently I wake up at 5:30 a.m., eat a big and nutritious breakfast and then go to the gym. I have a smoothie (frozen banana, blueberries, some nuts, and protein powder) after my work out then get ready for the day.\n\nI need at least seven hours of sleep a night. Sleep is necessary for peak performance. People think that by cutting out sleep they get more done but you are less productive during your awake hours due to fatigue.\n\nWhat I'm most proud of:\n\nLooking back, I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to do it without surgery. Weight loss is honestly a journey of personal growth. When you're obese, you kind of go to sleep in a way. You don't really see your own reflection in the mirror. You kind of look through yourself rather than at yourself.\n\nI spent many times in front of the mirror asking myself who I wanted to become and if I was going to let anything stand in my way. Many people put all their weight back on after a diet and for me, knowing what I know and how I felt, that's a sad fact.\n\nOscar Chavez\n\nThe regret:\n\nI regret being asleep at the wheel of life for so long. The self-neglect has had detrimental effects on my health such as permanent back injury and lots of excess skin on my arms and stomach. It was hard to see my body changing. I believe that hardship develops character and I wouldn't be the person I am without going through all this hardship.\n\nThe advice:\n\nMy advice for people struggling with their weight is to stay away from temporary solutions. Ask yourself, can I continue this lifestyle forever? This means that low-carb foods, meal deliveries, weight loss shakes etc. don't work long term and in fact damage your metabolism, making you gain weight faster.\n\nI actually have a free online class to help people that are struggling.\n\nWhat I've learned since appearing on \"The Voice Australia\" Season 2:\n\nThat people are horrible! One person wrote on a YouTube video of my performance, \"Stupid Fat Family.\" I'd like to sit down for a cup of tea with that person and find out what makes them so bitter and resentful.\n\nOther than that, I've learned that life is what you make it and \"excuses\" are a construct developed to protect someone's ego. Excuses are the reason people don't get anywhere in life.\n\nThat being said ...\n\nI loved the whole \"The Voice\" experience and would go on it again. \"The Voice\" treats people with integrity unlike the other show that makes fun of people. All the people that went on my season are in a group together and we all chat from time to time. A wonderful, life changing experience that's for sure!\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

Worse, that tension creeps into our love lives. Four in 10 of the study respondents said money issues have affected their relationships with their partners, while 1 in 5 said they have financial disagreements with their significant others at least monthly.\n\nWorrying about money doesn\u2019t just cause couples to quarrel. It can destroy your sex life, whether you\u2019re used to going at it solo or with a partner.\n\n\u201cChronic stress can wear down people\u2019s ability to let go and fully enjoy themselves during sex,\u201d said Azra Alic, a licensed clinical social worker in Palo Alto, California. \u201cPeople can become so preoccupied with worries about their financial future that they cannot concentrate on what\u2019s happening in front of them \u2015 in this case, sex,\u201d she said.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019re regularly putting in extra hours at the office or poring over financial statements, sheer exhaustion can get in the way of getting it on.\n\n\u201cBecause so much energy goes toward worrying, planning and, in some cases, overworking, some people find that there is not enough energy left over to get in the mood,\u201d Alic said.\n\nThe effects of money stress can manifest themselves in even more damaging ways. Rather than risk yet another fight about money, some couples choose to bottle up their emotions and avoid talking about finances at all.\n\nThose feelings \u201cbecome pent up and turn to resentment, which becomes like a cancer to the relationship. People can become passive-aggressive and withhold sex from their partners as an attempt to punish or to act out their rage,\u201d said psychotherapist Lauren Dummit, the co-founder and clinical director of Triune Therapy Group in Los Angeles and co-host of the KABC radio show \u201cBehind Closed Doors with Dr. Kate and Lauren.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a scientific explanation for the link between more stress and less sex drive.\n\n\u201cWhen we experience stress, our nervous system goes into a fight-or-flight response, releasing stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine,\u201d said Dummit.\n\nThese hormones, she said, are not harmful in small doses. \u201cHowever, when we experience chronic stress and the release of these toxic hormones is prolonged, our physical health is affected in many ways,\u201d Dummit said. \u201cFor example, cortisol suppresses our sex hormones.\u201d That, in turn, lowers your libido.\n\nHow To Get Your Groove Back\n\nIt\u2019s important to find ways to alleviate financial stress. Getting your money and your mind in the right place will lead to bigger rewards in the bedroom. Dr. Brian Doane, owner of Tampa Bay Counseling Services in Florida, has some advice.\n\nGet some sleep.\n\nGrabbing more zzz\u2019s can fight off those pesky stress hormones. \u201cMake time to get a little more sleep as it can help lower cortisol levels,\u201d said Doane.\n\nFind a healthy outlet.\n\nInstead of bottling up your emotions, find a healthy activity that helps you blow off some steam. Doane recommends spending more time outdoors. \u201cThis could be hiking, gardening, swimming, etc. Anything to help you take a break from life\u2019s stress,\u201d he said.\n\nFocus on your overall health.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to manage stress when your body isn\u2019t in the best shape. Try to make small improvements such as eating better and adding exercise to your daily routine. \u201cLow to moderate exercise has also been shown to help reduce stress, regulate hormones and increase libido,\u201d said Doane.\n\nTalk it out.\n\nImproving both your finances and your mental health is easier when you enlist help. \u201cPerhaps most importantly, talk to someone about your financial problems,\u201d said Doane.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming clean to your partner about the state of your bank account or meeting with a financial planner, confront the fear rather than avoiding it,\u201d he added.\n\nHave more sex.\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but one of the best things you can do to improve your lackluster sex life is to have sex anyway. You might not be in the mood beforehand, but you\u2019ll likely feel better afterward. As Dummit noted, that\u2019s because sex itself alleviates stress."

Mattarella giving Conte a mandate to form Italy\u2019s next government clears one of the final hurdles for the two parties before they can begin to run the country.\n\nBoth Lega and Five Star hold anti-migrant, anti-European Union views and look to bring the country closer to Russia through lifting economic sanctions against the Kremlin. The new populist government sets Italy up for a clash with the EU and brings more uncertainty for the country\u2019s already fractured politics.\n\nThe two non-traditional parties decided to band together after Italy\u2019s election in March left no outright winner and resulted in months of negotiations to form a governing coalition. Italians rejected the country\u2019s once-powerful establishment parties in the vote, leaving Lega and Five Star to fill the void.\n\n\u201cThe traditional Italian party system disappeared many elections ago,\u201d said Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is the detritus of that \u2015 which is a mess.\u201d\n\nA Lega and Five Star coalition was widely seen as a worst case scenario for the EU after Italy\u2019s vote, as both parties hold a longstanding opposition to the bloc. HuffPost Italia obtained an early draft of the coalition\u2019s governing contract in which the two parties hoped to renegotiate EU treaties and identify ways they could potentially opt out of the euro."

And is white rice really the devil it's made out to be?\n\n\"Rice is a great carbohydrate,\" Simone Austin, accredited practising dietitian and spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, told The Huffington Post Australia.\n\n\"Our body needs carbohydrates for energy so we should include it, even though people tend to demonise them. It\u2019s about the quantity to suit your own energy needs.\"\n\nRice is also low in fat and a source of protein -- plus it's super cheap and versatile.\n\n\"Rice is really economical for anyone, especially to feed a family,\" Austin said.\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to cook and really versatile, so it can help make good nutrition easy. You can use rice in a Mediterranean dish like risotto, in Asian cuisines like Vietnamese or Japanese, and in Spanish dishes.\"\n\nRice also contains essential nutrients such as iron, magnesium and B vitamins -- the content, however, depends on the type.\n\n\"You probably wouldn\u2019t lump them all into the one category, but in terms of the main nutrient they provide, which is carbohydrates, yes they could be lumped together. However, there\u2019s a few differences where some stand out,\" Austin said.\n\nWhite Rice\n\nWhite rice has the husk, bran layer and the germ removed. As a result of this extraction, white rice contains less nutrients than brown, black or red varieties.\n\n\"White rice has the husk \u2018polished\u2019 off and, if we look at 100 grams of white rice, it\u2019s got 6.3 grams of protein,\" Austin said.\n\nWhite rice comes in short-grain (for example, Aborio), medium-grain (Japanese-style) and long-grain (Basmati, Jasmine and Doongara), and for each of these varieties, the glycemic index differs.\n\n\"If you choose a Basmati or Doongara rice, they are low GI, whereas some of the other white rices are higher in glycemic index,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Apart from the Basmati and Doongara, white rice is rapidly digested and if you overeat on white rice, it can be an overload of carbohydrates.\n\n\"However, you don\u2019t tend to eat rice just on its own, you usually eat it in a meal. If you keep it to be a quarter or a third of the volume of your meal -- and then you\u2019ve got vegetables and protein -- that means the whole glycemic index changes.\n\n\"Look at rice as a component of your meal, rather than just on its own.\"\n\nOne reason why white rice is seen as inferior to the other types is due to its lower fibre content.\n\n\"White rice has very little fibre because the outside husk is gone,\" Austin said. \"White rice also contains iron but less than the brown rice.\"\n\nBrown Rice\n\nWhile white rice is milled to remove the bran layer and germ, brown rice is whole grain rice with only the outer hull removed. Brown rice is chewier than white rice, has a more nutty flavour and is more nutritious.\n\nAs with white rice, brown rice comes in long-grain, medium-grain and short-grain varieties.\n\n\"In terms of protein, from white to black rice, brown rice sits in the middle at about 7.2 grams per 100 grams,\" Austin told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"Brown rice is excellent for magnesium, which people are often looking for. It\u2019s also a good source of thiamine and iron, and it\u2019s got a moderate source of zinc.\n\n\"Because it\u2019s got the outside husk intact, brown rice also has the advantage of having a high fibre content of 3.2 grams per 100 grams.\"\n\nIn terms of glycemic index, brown rice releases at a \"medium\" rate in the body, meaning it will keep you fuller for longer compared to white rice.\n\nBlack Rice\n\nBlack rice is a different species of rice compared to brown and white. It has a distinct nutty, earthy flavour and takes much longer to cook than white rice.\n\n\"While white rice has 6.3 grams of protein per 100 grams, the black rice has got 9.1 grams of protein,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Black rice also has a lower glycemic index, so it means if you\u2019ve got diabetes it will be quite good as it\u2019s slow releasing.\n\n\"Black rice is also high in fibre, it\u2019s got 4.7 grams per 100 grams.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Rice\n\nRed rice has a unique colour due to its anthocyanin content, which also provides a big boost of antioxidants. This particular rice is available both hulled or unhulled.\n\nPer 100 grams, red rice has seven grams of protein and two grams of fibre.\n\nBoth red and black varieties contain higher amounts of nutrients compared to white rice, however they do come at a higher cost.\n\nThe question we all want to know is: which one is the healthiest?\n\n\"I would go for brown and black rice,\" Austin told HuffPost Australia.\n\n\"You would get more fibre eating brown and black rice. Fibre helps us feel full for longer, and it\u2019s also good for our bowels.\"\n\nIf you're not a fan of brown or black rice, Austin recommends mixing white (everyone's favourite) with the more nutritious varieties.\n\n\"I recommend mixing it up but going more for brown rice if you eat rice regularly and would like to feel fuller for longer,\" Austin said.\n\n\"I peronsally do a bit of a mixture. I put in the brown rice first, as it takes a bit longer, and then add the white rice in half way through. This works great for children. You could do the same with black rice too.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that you can't enjoy white rice -- just have it less frequently.\n\n\"For some dishes white rice is lovely and fluffy, so go ahead and enjoy it sometimes. But at other times try to get in some brown rice and try some black rice,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Brown rice is still economical and can be an easy way to increase your fibre intake, as well as your magnesium and B group vitamins.\"\n\nAs for those microwavable rice cups and sachets?\n\n\"Part of me thinks it\u2019s an extremely expensive way to buy something that is pretty easy to cook,\" Austin said.\n\n\"However, in terms of ease and quickness, I would rather people use these than eat something that's deep-fried.\n\n\"If it means it\u2019s going to make it easier to make a quick, balanced meal with veggies and egg or fish, then go for it. But economically and environmentally it might be better to cook your own rice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But establishing a new status quo to prevent a war that could kill millions likely depends on the outcome of follow-on talks that Trump has promised will begin next week.\n\nLed by national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the new negotiations are supposed to ensure progress toward Trump\u2019s goal: removing North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons capability. With the president personally directing the U.S. government\u2019s messaging, officials are being careful not to get out ahead of him. A White House spokesperson declined to share any details on what Pompeo and Bolton have planned next week and the State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut since the document the leaders signed Tuesday is so short on specifics, there\u2019s a lot to work out. Experts and lawmakers warn that it\u2019s unclear how much North Korea might be willing to concede, or how much the country might ask for in terms of greater access to the world economy or less U.S. defense cooperation with its rivals South Korea and Japan. Still, just continued dialogue can be a good thing, some commentators argue, particularly when the alternative might be war.\n\nAs the two sides continue to meet, the sanctions regime the Trump administration established to pressure Kim will remain in place, the president indicated Tuesday. But Pyongyang can count some wins: the propaganda value of the high-profile summit, and Trump\u2019s surprise decision to cancel joint U.S. military exercises with South Korea.\n\nThe blindsided South Koreans said they are trying to understand U.S. intentions, so top American officials will likely work in coming days to reassure them and downplay Trump remarks that adopted the North Korean view of the exercises as unnecessary provocations. Vice President Mike Pence is already engaged in damage control on Capitol Hill; one senator said Pence told concerned lawmakers some joint operations would continue, but his press secretary then denied that claim.\n\nThe key thing for the Trump administration, then, is to figure out what it is trying to achieve. The U.S. will not give North Korea the normalcy and benefits Trump has promised until there is a \u201ccomplete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Pompeo said Monday. Denuclearization requires multiple difficult tasks \u2015 having Pyongyang accept serious international inspections, finding ways to penetrate its notoriously secretive systems without falling for propaganda and binding a regime used to international subterfuge to no future nuclear development. It\u2019ll take more than one round next week to cover all that. Achieving President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, for instance, took more than a decade and many marathon negotiations.\n\n\u201cIn propaganda terms, [Kim] came out ahead when you look past the soaring rhetoric and warm atmosphere during the summit. Fortunately, the United States did not ease the pressure of sanctions, and made clear that sanctions relief can only come with concrete steps toward denuclearization. So we have not given up our most important leverage as the action shifts to follow-on talks led by [Pompeo],\u201d former U.S. ambassador to South Korea Alexander Vershbow wrote.\n\nPompeo\u2019s boss, however, appears to simply want this process over and done with. Trump has cast doubt on the need to verify North Korea actually winding down its nuclear program, and is already predicting regular U.S.-North Korean ties will develop very fast. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet many times,\u201d Trump said of his budding relationship with Kim. And he has a deep belief that the North Korean leader will act in good faith and in the interests of his people\u2019s future, even justifying Kim\u2019s massive human rights violations by saying he had to be \u201ctough.\u201d\n\nRights abuses were one of several particular concerns that made no appearance in the two leaders\u2019 declaration Tuesday. They\u2019ll be discussed in the future, Trump said \u2015 one more aspect of the two sides continuing to keep talking while, experts warn, North Korea deftly consolidates its new place on the world stage.\n\n\u201cThe world,\u201d the president promised, \u201cwill see a major change.\u201d"
