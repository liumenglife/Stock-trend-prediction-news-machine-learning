			"text": "There have been Mile High Club stories for as long as there have been airplanes \u2014 or at least, it feels that way.\n\nWith so much information circulating the internet on \u201chow to\u201d join, it's obvious people are intrigued by the Mile High Club, even if they have yet to join. But what are the rules on airlines? How much trouble could you get in? While it might sound fun and exciting, no one wants to get arrested for getting busy on a plane.\n\nWhen it comes to repercussions for joining the club, reports are thoroughly mixed. Just this past March, two strangers met on a Virgin Atlantic flight, only to hook up in the bathroom mid-air. The couple later got into a squabble back in their seats. Upon arrival in their destination, the female passenger was detained for behaving, \u201cin an abusive and threatening manner which severely disrupted the flight.\"\n\nNorm Pattis, a criminal attorney, told Travel + Leisure that banning passengers for unsavory behavior is within airlines' rights. \u201cAirlines can prohibit folks from using their services so long as they don\u2019t discriminate for prohibited reasons, such as age, gender or disability,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a victim of airline coitus interruptus, the airline can issue you a notice not to return. Most courts would enforce the ban.\u201d\n\nClemens Sehi, a travel writer and creative director at Travellers Archive, brings up a 2015 story, where a flight attendant was charging a fee for entry into the Mile High Club. She wound up making nearly $2,400 per flight by charging for sexual services. Upon discovery, she was dismissed from her duties. This, of course, is an extreme case.\n\nChristy* (not her real name), a current full-time flight attendant for a major U.S. airline tells T+L she didn\u2019t receive any specific training. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think our airline has specific guidelines on this. It\u2019s more of a, \u2018If you see it, stop it,\u2019 kind of policy,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, as flight attendants, we do have the authority to have police meet the aircraft. If it\u2019s indecent exposure, you could get fined for that. But I don\u2019t believe the airline fines passengers for getting freaky in the lavatories.\u201d\n\nIs this something flight attendants are taught to look out for as part of general practice? By all accounts, the answer appears to be \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nBrian Palmer addressed these issues in 2011 Slate article: \u201cApparently the issue isn't directly addressed in flight attendant school, but attendants generally \u2018knock, inquire politely, and barge in if necessary.\u2019\u201d Certainly to some passengers, this sort of light acknowledgement almost feels like an invitation to press your luck.\n\nHere is the bottom line: When it comes to the Mile High Club, if you\u2019re doing it in the bathroom, you likely can\u2019t get in any serious trouble. You could be banned from the airline, maybe, but even that is pretty unlikely.\n\nWhile nearly every airline we reached out to declined to comment, American Airlines responded to our query, adding a little color to this notably shady story. Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American Airlines said, \u201cThe only club American recommends is the Admirals Club.\u201d\n\nSehi says there are no official consequences, only general practices carried out to each airline\u2019s discretion. \u201cInterestingly, you do not really have to expect real consequences, except a warning and evil looks. While Lufthansa does not rule out that sexual acts of passengers are reported because of the violation of manners, Singapore Airlines handles this differently. If fellow passengers feel disturbed, stewardesses simply offer a drink to the troublemakers to get them out of the lavatory.\u201d\n\nT+L reached out to Lufthansa for comment, but received no reply.\n\nAlthough attempting to join the club in the lavatory is unlikely to land you in jail, there could be serious legal ramifications should you try anything out in the open. Pattis told T+L that airplane sex could be considered a felony offense, but only if you\u2019re caught doing it in public, as in, in your seat, in front of other people. \u201cYou must be caught in the act to make a convincing criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nOur main question after all of this: How do two people fit inside an airplane lavatory? Christy thinks the tiny bathrooms on airplanes are no accident. \u201cA senior flight attendant told me in the old days, when airplane lavatories were much larger, it was a very common thing. Downsizing lavatories might be a reason we don\u2019t see it that much anymore.\u201d\n\nAs far as we can gather from recent news stories, small bathrooms are not going to stop people from trying. But you are looking to get busy on an airplane, prepare yourself for possible embarrassment (and a strained back).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel + Leisure."

			"text": "Today, I heard a story that I\u2019ve heard before. Google plans a game platform that will take on Xbox and PlayStation, the headlines say \u2014 all sourcing back to an article by Jason Schreier at Kotaku.\n\nIf the name seems familiar, that is for good reason. Schreier has broken too many stories to count. If he says Google wants to make a game console, I don\u2019t doubt it. Google wants to make a game console.\n\nBut wanting something isn\u2019t the same as making it real, is it?\n\nLike I said \u2014 I\u2019ve heard this story before. Google collaborated with Asus to build the Nexus Player, an Android-powered TV box/game console released in 2014. No one bought it, of course, just as no one bought every other Android-based TV box/game console hybrid that emerged after the now-dead Ouya generated millions on Kickstarter.\n\nThe pitch has evolved since then. The new project, code-named Yeti, may include a hardware component, but rumors suggest the silicon inside a Google console won\u2019t be the star of the show. Instead, Yeti will likely rely on a streaming service similar to Nvidia\u2019s GeForce Now or Sony\u2019s PlayStation Now. Games will be beamed to your living room through the internet instead of processed on the console.\n\nIn a way, relying on the cloud makes Yeti more plausible. Google has no experience building console hardware, but the cloud? Yeah, it can do that. There is one big problem, though \u2014 no one has proven that streaming games from the cloud makes sense. The idea came into vogue around 2009, pioneered by the launch of OnLive, a serious attempt to make game streaming work.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. OnLive went into a downward spiral and was eventually acquired by Sony. Its competitors were also sold to other, larger companies, which have since used the technology only to build niche services. The tech can basically work in ideal conditions \u2014 a solid wired connection with lots of bandwidth \u2014 but even then, most gamers don\u2019t seem to care. Why stream games from the cloud when they can just pop in a disc or download them once?\n\nI have no doubt Google wants to make more money from games. I also seriously doubt Google can make it happen. Schreier\u2019s report expresses this skepticism, too, stating that, \u201cGoogle\u2019s history of starting and abandoning initiatives is a red flag.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, Google probably is working on a game console. Just don\u2019t get too excited \u2014 because it\u2019s probably never going to launch.\n\nThe views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not reflect the beliefs of Digital Trends."

Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo gets tips from author Jenn Segal and Famous Dave Anderson. LISTEN HERE:\n\nJuicy Steakhouse Burgers\n\nWHO DOESN'T LOVE a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger? Problem is, they're difficult to replicate at home because most steakhouses blend different cuts of beef--like sirloin, chuck, and short ribs--to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers. It's certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your butcher for a special blend, but it's not always practical. Fortunately, there's an easier way. By combining ordinary supermarket ground beef with a panade and lots of seasoning, you can make sensational steakhouse-style burgers in no time. These burgers have made me a star among my children's friends. My daughter's friend Allie sweetly nicknamed them Segal Burgers-- it stuck, and now we all call them that too.\n\nBy Jennifer Segal Servings: 10 Ingredients 2 pieces white sandwich bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 1/3 cup low fat milk 2-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 garlic cloves, minced 1-1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons ketchup 3 pounds 85% lean ground beef 3 scallions, finely sliced (optional) Non-flammable cooking spray to grease grill 10 hamburger buns Instructions Preheat the grill to high heat. In a large bowl, mash the bread and milk together with a fork until it forms a chunky paste. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup and mix well. Add the ground beef and scallions and break the meat up with your hands. Gently mix everything together until just combined. Do not overmix. Divide the mixture into ten equal portions and form loose balls. Flatten the balls into 3/4-inch patties about 4-1/2 inches around. Form a slight depression in the center of each patty to prevent the burgers from puffing up on the grill.Grease the grill with non-flammable cooking spray. Grill the burgers, covered, until nicely browned on the first side, 2-4 minutes. Flip burgers and continue cooking for a few minutes more until desired doneness is reached. Before serving, toast the buns on the cooler side of the grill if desired.\n\nReprinted from Once Upon a Chef by Jennifer Segal with permission by Chronicle Books, 2018 Juicy Steakhouse Burgers (a.k.a \"Segal Burgers\")\n\nFollow Lilian Woo on Twitter: @LilianNY\n\nClick HERE to listen to more FOX & Food podcasts"

Those pesky bugs can easily ruin a fun summer night.\n\nAlthough there are the typical ways to get rid of those mosquitos (like using DEET or another one of these 7 mosquito repellent tips), there are a few unique hacks that can help your mosquito-blocking efforts even further.\n\nRemove water sources\n\nYou may be surprised to know that having accessible water sources can stand as a threat to the number of mosquitos around your home. Why? Because mosquitos actually lay their eggs in standing or slow moving water. By cutting these water sources, you are cutting the number of mosquitos laying eggs around your home\u2014and in return, having fewer mosquitos around the house in general.\n\nNow water can accumulate around your home easier than you think. Some of the biggest culprits of water sources include unused tires, cans, pools, and pool covers. Any plastic containers or ceramic pots for planting that are empty and collect water should be removed. Make sure to clean out your gutters as much as possible, and always keep an eye out for water build up around the house. Bird baths are also an easy target for mosquitos.\n\nUse oil from lemon eucalyptus\n\nThis may seem like a myth, but oil from lemon eucalyptus is actually recommended by multiple government sources as an insect repellent (including the Center for Disease Control and Prevention). It doesn\u2019t just have to be DEET. If you\u2019re looking for a more natural remedy to keep the mosquitos away, this oil will do the trick.\n\nAvoid scented body products\n\nAlthough some scents work as a repellent for mosquitoes, other body lotions or perfumes can actually attract these pests. The best thing to do is stay away from fancy smelling perfumes, colognes, body washes or lotions if you plan on spending time outside during high mosquito activity hours. These hours are typically dusk to dawn between April and October.\n\nWear light clothing\n\nNot light in weight, although in the summer that is a given. But light-colored clothing. Turns out mosquitoes are attracted to darker colored materials. As for the length, if you can cover up, you should do so. Wearing long sleeves and pants will significantly reduce the number of mosquito bites you accumulate by the end of the evening.\n\nNow that you know a few hacks that truly work when getting rid of those mosquitos, you need to stop believing these 7 myths about mosquito control.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Family Handyman."

			"text": "So, it turns out that our little neighborhood (made up of three hundred houses in the city of Durham, North Carolina) uses a social media app called Nextdoor. And \u2013 it turns out \u2013 this is the only form of social media in which I actually, participate. Because, I\u2019m kinda crazy enough to think that if I am going to post a picture of my lunch, I want to be able to share it with those with whom I might actually share this lunch \u2013 my neighbors.\n\nSo, I read Nextdoor updates daily, and I receive messages as they are posted so that I can respond to and pray for the neighbors whom I do not yet know. I pray about lost dogs, and I donate school supplies. Every time someone posts a request for meals for a sick, grieving, or newly blessed \u2013 by \u2013 newborn neighbor, I\u2019m on it. I look carefully at the food allergies and preferences. Over the years, I have developed go \u2013 to recipes for a variety of food needs.\n\nMy husband, Kent, and I believe that practicing daily, ordinary, Christian hospitality is worth the cost\u2013even if it doubles our grocery budget (or sometimes triples it!).\n\nIt costs money and time and heartache to run a house that values radically ordinary hospitality and nightly table fellowship, and we are all in.\n\nOver the past sixteen years of marriage, we have given away a lot of things. We give away many meals each week (those we serve here, those we serve at church, those we send in Pyrex pans to neighbors who have new babies or new knees, and those we mail to brothers and sisters in prison via iCare packages). We give away our time. We share our house. We don\u2019t rent space in our house. If we did that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to give it away. We give away cars when we have had the means to do so. We have never suffered for the absence of anything. Paul\u2019s words ring in my ears: \u201cTo me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things\u201d (Eph. 3:8\u20139). I like better the King James rendering: \u201cAnd to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery . . . \u201d\n\nChristian hospitality brings together the mystery of union with Christ and the fellowship of the saints to gather in close the stranger and the outcast and the chronically lonely. We make gospel bridges into our home because we notice the people around us and their needs. We see people whom God has put into our lives \u2013 especially the difficult ones \u2013 as image bearers of a Holy God and therefore deserving of our best. Hospitality is image \u2013 bearer driven, because Christ\u2019s blood pumps me whole. It is not time, convenience, and calendar driven. If it were, none of it would happen. None of this grace would be mine to hold and to share.\n\nHospitality requires daily Bible reading, deep repentance, dark mornings in solitude, and the daily willingness to forgive others whether or not they ask.\n\nHospitality renders our houses hospitals and incubators. When I was in a lesbian community, this is how we thought of our homes. I learned a lot in that community about how to shore up a distinctive culture within and to live as a despised but hospitable and compassionate outsider in a transparent and visible way. I learned how to create a habitus that reflected my values to a world that despised me.\n\nI learned to face my fears and feed my enemies.\n\nEngaging in radically ordinary hospitality means we provide the time necessary to build strong relationships with people who think differently than we do as well as build strong relationships from within the family of God.\n\nRadically ordinary hospitality shows this hurting world what authentic Christianity looks like.\n\nSo here I am, a new creature in Christ, yes, but still wearing my Birkenstocks. Lobotomized, no. A beneficiary of God\u2019s grace, both common and saving, with eyes wide open to behold what contagious grace looks like \u2013 and what it does to people and the world and the church. And my house, by God\u2019s grace, is still an incubator and a hospital.\n\nAs we grow to be more like Christ in practicing daily, ordinary, radical hospitality, the Lord blesses richly for it, adding to His kingdom, creating a new culture and a new reputation for what it means to be a Christian to the watching world.\n\nAs we practice daily, ordinary, radical hospitality \u2013 strangers become neighbors, and neighbors become the family of God\u2026\n\nAnd our hearts, homes, and lives find the key to greater joy.\n\nThis post is adapted from \u201cThe Gospel Comes with a House Key: Practicing Radically Ordinary Hospitality in Our Post \u2013 Christian World\u201d by Rosaria Butterfield \u00a92018.

He was waiting for his afternoon addiction recovery meeting to begin.\n\nSam has been clean and sober since last summer when he was arrested for driving under the influence. At the time, he had been an alcoholic and a regular heroin user.\n\nHe's not alone. According to the National Institutes of Health, almost 10 million adult men have \u201cAlcohol Use Disorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's gotten to the point now where it's just-- I'm either going to get out of here,\u201d Hall reflected, \u201cor I'm gonna die this way. I mean, that's it.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that children of alcoholics are more likely to become addicted themselves. Sam\u2019s father was an alcoholic who managed to quit drinking, but that didn\u2019t stop Sam from falling victim to the same disease.\n\nBut, it eventually started to hurt to drink. So, I eventually moved on to opiates, which eventually led on to heroin. - Sam Hall\n\n\u201cI used to be a really bad alcoholic,\u201d Hall explained. \u201cI drank profusely. Eventually, it started to hurt my body when I drank. 'Cause I was drinking a lot. I'm only 36 right now. The level that I was drinking at was crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, it eventually started to hurt to drink,\u201d Hall admitted. \u201cSo, I eventually moved on to opiates, which eventually led on to heroin.\u201d\n\nMen not only abuse alcohol at higher rates than women, but they are also more likely to use almost all types of illicit drugs.\n\nHall is trying to stay sober, and working on his recovery in an unexpected place \u2013 jail.\n\nThat jail, in Kenton County, Kentucky, is run by Terry Carl, the elected county jailer.\n\n\u201cI've been here all my life,\u201d Carl told Fox News. \u201cI know the people. I really care for the people.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the jailer started an innovative pilot program at the jail to provide in-house rehab for inmates.\n\n\u201cA lot of it had to do with people leaving the jail,\u201d Carl explained. \u201cThey've been in here, say, two weeks, six months. And-- they would leave the jail. And a couple days later they'd-- overdose and-- and die.\u201d\n\nSeeking a solution, Carl recruited Jason Merrick, a social worker and certified drug and alcohol counselor to run this new \u201ctherapeutic community.\u201d\n\nThough some are ordered by the court to enroll in the program, the vast majority of men sign themselves up, and the program is so successful that it has a running waitlist.\n\nWhy not plug in a relatively low-cost social service program that would give someone a chance at life instead of just doing time and going back out and doing the same things over and over again. - Jason Merrick\n\nMerrick told Fox News that about 83 percent of the men and women booked into the Kenton County Detention Center find themselves in jail \u201cindirectly or directly related to their substance abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not plug in a relatively low-cost social service program that would give someone a chance at life instead of just doing time and going back out and doing the same things over and over again,\u201d Merrick lamented.\n\nThat rehab program, called Unit 104, houses 70 men just like Hall. They have access to alcoholics and narcotics anonymous meetings, along with a daily schedule of classes to prepare for the G.E.D. or future job interviews. Several times a day the men sit together and share their stories with one another, gathering strength and reminding one another how far they\u2019ve come and how much work remains ahead.\n\nThe men of Unit 104 may not have known each other before coming to jail but they all share the belief that their addictions to drugs and alcohol brought them to this point.\n\nHall didn\u2019t hesitate when asked about what he fears. \u201cMy worst case scenario is going back out and using again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the worst case scenario, 'cause it's death.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Hall has firsthand experience. He lost his wife Melissa to a drug overdose, just a few months after he entered jail on charges of DUI and wanton endangerment.\n\nHall said his wife was using drugs before getting ready for work one morning, and overdosed at home, not far from their young daughter. His worst fears were confirmed when he was pulled into a private room and told the news.\n\nBecause Hall was incarcerated at the time, he was unable to attend her funeral, something he struggles with daily, on top of the guilt he feels after introducing drugs into her life.\n\n\u201cI didn't get to go to the funeral. So, I've been here the whole time,\u201d he shared. \u201cMy wife-- she never did anything before she met me. And then it kinda transcended into her using as well. And it's very hard to deal with the guilt. I deal with it every day.\u201d\n\nHall believes his three children, including that young daughter, will motivate him to stay on the straight and narrow when he leaves jail.\n\n\u201cThe only thing she wants is for me to come home,\u201d he said, thinking of his youngest. \u201cShe just wants-- she just wants daddy to come home. And it's very-- it's very-- it's very hard. Very hard.\u201d\n\nNo one has to die. This is preventable. This is treatable. - Jason Merrick\n\nThe jail\u2019s rehab program has become a source of hope for these men, stuck in a deadly cycle. Merrick said that they are seeing 71 percent of the clients who complete the program do not return to jail within the first 12 months after being released. \u201cWhen you look at the opposite, those that are not engaged in treatment and not engaged in programming, 70 percent are likely to come back. So it's exactly flipped,\u201d said Merrick, pointing to their remarkable success rate.\n\n\u201cNo one has to die,\u201d Merrick asserted. \u201cThis is preventable. This is treatable.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Hall has been anxious to get home and back to work. Ultimately, the goal shared by those administering and participating in the program is that more men in Kentucky will see things the way Hall does.\n\n\u201cThings will get better if you try to make them better,\u201d Hall said with confidence. \u201cIt's not easy. [A]nything that's worth doing is not easy at all.\u201d"

Exit polls for the presidential race have not yet been released.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nPolls are beginning to close across much of Mexico for Sunday's presidential election.\n\nThey're scheduled to end at 6 p.m. in each of Mexico's three summer time zones, meaning the last to close will come in the northwestern state of Baja California.\n\nEdiane Da Costa Pereira is a Brazilian who became a naturalized citizen in Mexico and voted Sunday in Tijuana, across the border from San Diego.\n\nShe said she backed leftist front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and called him less than ideal but the \"best of the bad\" options. She said a Lopez Obrador presidency is a good way to kick the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, out of power.\n\nBut 20-year-old Jose Corrales said he supported PRI candidate Jose Antonio Meade for his \"Advance With You\" program, which would offer support to citizens according to their specific, individual needs.\n\nLopez Obrador has had a wide advantage in most polls over Meade, conservative candidate Ricardo Anaya of a right-left coalition and independent Jaime \"El Bronco\" Rodriguez.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has cast his vote in elections to choose his successor.\n\nPena Nieto tells reporters at the polling station that his administration will be \"absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected.\"\n\nCandidate Jose Antonio Meade of Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party has been running third in most polls, behind front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the leftist Morena party and conservative Ricardo Anaya of a right-left coalition.\n\nPena Nieto said Sunday that the vote \"should reaffirm us in our democratic vocation.\"\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe head of Mexico's electoral institute says voting across the country has been proceeding \"peacefully, without major incidents.\" Lorenzo Cordova says only four of the 156,807 polling places failed to open.\n\nFront-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador voted early, saying \"today the people will decide between more of the same or a real change.\"\n\nCandidates Ricardo Anaya and Jose Antonio Meade both said they were expecting to be celebrating when polls close later Sunday.\n\n___\n\n8:20 a.m.\n\nPolls have opened in Mexico's presidential and local elections, and front-running candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is among the first to line up at his polling place in Mexico City.\n\nWhile the left-leaning candidate holds a commanding lead in polls, voters who don't like him also lined up early.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Juan Carlos Limas said he's \"concerned that some candidates are making proposals that are impossible, because they're very expensive to carry out.\" He says he's voting for Ricardo Anaya, candidate of a right-left coalition."

Students remain with their homeroom groups for 30 percent of the school day.\n\n\u201cMy daughter who is 11 was like, \u2018Wow, this is crazy. They are talking about separating by color,\u2019\u201d one father, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Post.\n\n\u201cAnd I was thinking how antiquated is this? This is backwards. It\u2019s almost like segregation now.\u201d\n\nAfter a Post inquiry, Kassen sent a message to parents Wednesday detailing last year\u2019s race-placement \u201cinitiative\u201d \u2014 although multiple sources told the paper they weren't aware of it.\n\nUCLA PROFESSOR DIES DURING 'MUMMIFICATION' RITUAL AT HOLLYWOOD EXECUTIVE'S HOME\n\nStill, parents said the school always let race play a heavy hand in class placement. One mother said for three years all but one of the 10 non-white students in her child\u2019s grade were assigned to the same class in lower school.\n\nWhen the policy became more widely understood in early June, parents started to express their displeasure.\n\nThe Post reported that Kassen, who made $403,039 in total compensation in 2016, emailed parents on June 12 to say the placement policy would be reviewed.\n\nEight days later, he emailed again, stating that he would end the policy, but would continue to keep \u201crace as a critical, but not primary, determinant.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a school possibly do that? I don\u2019t know if I would necessarily send a child to a school that separated by race,\u201d Amanda Uhry, president of Manhattan Private School Advisors, told the Post.\n\nUhry continued: \u201c1964, remember that? We had segregation in America. What is this? It\u2019s segregation!\u201d\n\nOne educational consultant in New York told the Post that the policy is meant to help black or Latino students feel less isolated by giving them safety in numbers.\n\nHowever, she said it would be only a temporary solution and would not address larger, systemic issues at work.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, there still isn\u2019t enough diversity in New York City independent schools. This is just a band-aid. You need to advocate for more financial aid and diversity,\u201d she said.\n\nFox News' Madeline Fish contributed to this report."

Wrong is wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Final Thoughts.\n\nWhether or not it was intended as a joke, what Roseanne tweeted about Valerie Jarrett was indefensible. Roseanne knows it, admitted it, and apologized for it. I give her credit for that. She even asked fellow conservatives not to defend her - and she\u2019s right on the money.\n\nBut look, we all know the media double standard applies here. I get why some of you are outraged Roseanne\u2019s show was canceled over a tweet, while other so-called comedians \u2013 some of whom work for ABC, Roseanne\u2019s network - have said and done despicable things.\n\nTomi Lahren: Take a Moment to Remember What Memorial Day Is Really About\n\nTomi Lahren on New NFL Anthem Policy: Americans Used Their Remotes and Made a Difference\n\nWho could forget Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s blackface comedy act, or his mocking of Melania Trump\u2019s accent? And another ABC personality - Joy Behar - likening Christianity to mental illness? Meantime, over at HBO, what about Bill Maher\u2019s use of the \u201cn\u201d word? And then there\u2019s the vulgar Samantha Bee over at TBS. She was just forced to apologize after stooping to a vile new low by calling Ivanka Trump the C-word \u2013 the most disgusting of all profanities for women.\n\nThese are all examples of wrong and offensive speech. But it\u2019s the pro-Trump conservatives who must walk the plank into professional purgatory, while those on the left are given a pass, and move on.\n\nWe all know it, and it\u2019s frustrating. BUT here\u2019s the deal: We know we\u2019re held to a different standard. We must rise to the occasion, and act the right way. The last thing we should do is lower our standards, even when the left gets away with lowering theirs. Our words, actions and ideas are more powerful when we can stand behind them.\n\nI know this from experience. I\u2019ve said and tweeted a couple things I\u2019m not proud of. I won\u2019t sit here and try to justify those missteps.\n\nInstead, I took ownership. I will never apologize for speaking the truth. But I will always apologize when I mess up.\n\nI think canceling the Roseanne show over a tweet may be a bit of an over-reaction. But that\u2019s not my call.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should nail Roseanne the person to the cross for this, either. She is paying the price, and fully accepts the consequences. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll forgive her.\n\nAnd to those on the left, and in the mainstream media, trying to use Roseanne as a caricature of all Trump supporters, shame on you. Many of us have denounced what she said - which has nothing to do with our party, our movement, or our true beliefs.\n\nWe aren\u2019t perfect. But most of us do know right from wrong.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts. From LA, God Bless and take care.\n\nTomi Lahren: 'Knee-Jerk Reactions' on Gun Control 'Never the Solution'\n\nTomi Lahren on Jerusalem Embassy Dedication: Trump 'Delivered on His Promise'"

			"text": "There\u2019s nothing quite like a juicy cut of beef to celebrate a birthday, holiday or the end of a long week, and a pepper-crusted ribeye or tender flank steak does just the trick. But if you\u2019re among the home cooks who are hesitant to make steak, have no fear. Many folks who feel quite comfortable in the kitchen otherwise are guilty of cooking dry, tough meat.\n\nRead on to avoid the most common mistakes, and get ready to cook the perfect steak every time.\n\nMistake 1: Not using enough seasoning\n\nYou may be afraid of making steak too salty or overpowering it with spices, but trust us: Caution doesn\u2019t pay when it comes to seasoning. Since you can\u2019t season the steak\u2019s interior, playing it too safe will deprive you of rich flavors and a bold crust.\n\nWhat to do instead: Season the meat heartily on both sides about 35 to 40 minutes before cooking. For inspiration, check out our favorite DIY spice blends.\n\nMistake 2: Cooking steak cold\n\nWhen it comes to steak, it can be hard to be patient, but you never want to pull steak straight from the fridge to throw on the grill. Plan ahead, giving the meat time to reach room temperature. A cold steak will cook unevenly, potentially causing the outside to burn while the inside remains undercooked.\n\nWhat to do instead: Depending on the cut, allow a half-hour to two hours for the meat to sit on the counter.\n\nMistake 3: Getting the wrong cut\n\nChoosing a steak isn\u2019t as easy as grabbing it from the cooler and heading to the checkout line. There are plenty of varieties, and not all of them should be cooked the same way. For instance, T-bones thrive on the grill, but a boneless ribeye does best in a frying pan (thanks to the fat running through it). Treating all steaks the same can deprive you of the best possible flavor.\n\nWhat to do instead: Learn your cuts and preferred cooking style. If you forget which cut you like, remember that the higher the price point, the more likely it\u2019s meant to be fried. (Any good butcher will be happy to provide answers and advice.) Want to get more creative with your cut of choice? Grill up our favorite steak recipes.\n\nMistake 4: Choosing a lean cut\n\nThere\u2019s a time and place for lean cuts, but steak night isn\u2019t one of them. Lean cuts tend to be tough and dry, since fat is what provides most of the flavor.\n\nWhat to do instead: Pick out a steak with a healthy amount of marbling (the fat which shows up as white flecks and lines). It may be more expensive, but the tenderness and juiciness will be well worth it.\n\nMistake 5: Turning the steak only once\n\nIt\u2019s a common misconception that the best way to keep a steak tender and juicy is to flip it once. While you may get photo-worthy grill marks, your steak won\u2019t be any more delicious. In fact, with this method, you may be drying out the steak.\n\nWhat to do instead: Get into the habit of turning your steak multiple times as it cooks, especially when the heat is high. Extra flips allow the steak to cook more quickly (up to 30 percent faster than the one-flip method.) This is what will give you a juicier steak. You\u2019ll also find that this method helps the meat cook evenly, without much curling along the edges.\n\nBonus Test Kitchen tip: It\u2019s essential to use tongs instead of a fork to flip your meat.\n\nFor five more mistakes you (might) make when grilling steak, continue reading the original article at Taste of Home."

That was up from 21 percent in 2015.\n\nThe same survey says 31 percent of adults indicated they were obese last year, up slightly. Another, more rigorous government study has also found adult obesity is inching up.\n\nCOUPLE WHO MET AT SONIC, BONDED OVER TATER TOTS, TAKE ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS AT FAST-FOOD CHAIN\n\nSo if more Americans are exercising, how can more also be getting fatter?\n\nSome experts think the findings may reflect two sets of people \u2014 the haves and have-nots of physical fitness, so to speak.\n\n\"It's possible the people becoming more active are already normal weight,\" said John Jakicic, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center.\n\nThe numbers come from an in-person annual national survey that for more than 60 years has been an important gauge of U.S. health trends. Roughly 35,000 adults answer the survey every year, including questions about how often, how long and how vigorously they exercise in their leisure time.\n\nThe survey gives a good sense of trends, but it's not perfect. People generally overstate how much they exercise, just as they overstate their height and lowball their weight, Jakicic said.\n\nTen-year-old federal recommendations say adults should do weightlifting or other muscle-strengthening exercise at least twice a week. They also advise adults to do at least 75 minutes a week of high-intensity aerobic activity, such as running, or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, or a combination of the two.\n\n'JOLLY' JANITOR WEEPS UPON RECEIVING $2,000 VACATION FROM STUDENTS\n\nIn a report being released Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at survey responses from 2010 through 2015 and found that level of leisure-time exercise was more common in some states than others.\n\nNearly a third of non-elderly adults in Colorado, Idaho, and New Hampshire met exercise guidelines. Only about one-seventh in Mississippi, Kentucky and South Carolina did.\n\nHigher levels of exercise were more common in people who were working than those who weren't, the study also found.\n\nNationally, exercise levels were flat during the years covered by the CDC report. But more recent data show more adults said they were exercising at recommended levels in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIt's not clear why, said Jena Shaw Tronieri, a University of Pennsylvania weight-loss expert.\n\nOne possibility: Many adults exercise to manage stress, and the last two years have seen increasing political and social turmoil.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\"I don't know if that will explain the increase recently, but we know those situational factors are part of the context,\" she said.\n\nOf course, unhealthy eating has a lot to do with obesity. Research indicates that \"a change in diet is needed to see any dent or reduction in obesity,\" said the CDC's Tainya Clarke, one of the authors of the report."

Boys will be held accountable for their actions. I hate to see an Australian store, who makes such great pjs, put such a sexist statement on a t-shirt intended for young boys. Excusing boys of their behavior is not a step in the right direction. It\u2019s 2018,\u201d she wrote on June 20, according to the Herald.\n\nHarris told the Herald the phrase didn\u2019t sit well with her because of the connotation it sent that men \"tend to get away with stuff just because they are boys.\"\n\n\"I just think that it allows boys to do whatever they want because they are boys. It gives them an excuse for inappropriate behavior.

In the light of your feedback, we have decided to withdraw this item from sale,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nHowever, after removing the shirt, the company has been inundated on social media with comments from angry customers who think Harris was being overly sensitive, arguing that Peter Alexander shouldn\u2019t have \u201cgiven in\u201d to her wishes.\n\nWhen one person suggested people be mad at Harris and not the company, someone responded: \u201cBut she didn't remove the top for sale, the store did that and they shouldn't have given into it.\u201d\n\nCommenters have also been posting about other products on the company\u2019s Facebook page, sarcastically saying maybe those products should be pulled as well.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cPerhaps the \u2018You're so fine!\u2019 shirt should be taken from the shelves before someone sees it and decides that it encourages sexual harassment by the wearer?\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cShame on you Peter Alexander for removing the \u2018Boys will be boys\u2019 [pajamas].

			"text": "Chip and Joanna Gaines of \"Fixer Upper\" are known for performing makeover magic, but will the dynamic duo be responsible for million-dollar makeover magic?\n\nOne of the memorable homes featured on the show may reveal if their beloved aesthetic translates into a seven-digit sale.\n\nThe \"Faceless Bunker\" house from season 2 is now on the market for $1.15 million. If a fan of the popular show pays full asking price, the home will sell for quadruple Waco's median list price of $265,000.\n\nHowever, this house is far larger than an average Waco home, so let's compare apples to apples.\n\nThis four-bedroom, 3.5-bath house measures 4,113 square feet, which works out to $280 per square foot. The median price per square foot of a home in the area is currently a budget-friendly $112\u2014way less than half of the price of this Magnolia-renovated beauty. Gaines premium pricing, anyone?\n\nThe home was last on the market in 2014 for $349,900. If the current owners paid somewhere in the neighborhood of that price, we figure they stand to almost triple their investment, minus renovation costs, of course. And what a grand renovation it was by the \"Fixer Upper\" crew.\n\nLet's take a look at what Chip and Joanna did to justify the price jump.\n\nFirst, they gave the place a \"modern beach home\" vibe, removing the brick and added new siding.\n\nThey also added a faux balcony to bring some dimension to the front of the house and installed new windows. The front door was replaced and painted, and all-new landscaping was added to create a tropical feeling for the home.\n\nInside, the entire layout and orientation was overhauled. A new stairwell with iron railings and steel cables was installed. French doors and windows were added, and the fireplace was simplified and refaced with black tile. Bamboo flooring was added throughout the first floor.\n\nThe kitchen was also redone and relocated to a more central area of the house. New windows, cabinets, countertops, a peninsula, shelves, and state-of-the-art appliances were added. The open area was also extended to include a dedicated homework space and a walk-in pantry.\n\nThe dining room got a new set of French doors, along with new flooring and light fixtures.\n\nAll the bedrooms and bathrooms were renovated, with the master bath being a particular highlight of their work. Chip and Jo also added a game room to the house.\n\nThere were a couple of things that Chip and Joanna didn't change, but helped to highlight: the gorgeous views of Lake Waco and the nearly 2-acre lot. Why mess with perfection?\n\nThe price of this home is ambitious. The \"Plain Gray House\" from season 4 was much smaller, but it landed on the market for only $260,000. The famous \"barndominium\" and shotgun house both had asking prices in the million-dollar range, and neither one shows any evidence of selling.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Realtor.com."

			"text": "Way, way back in 2002 I wrote a book about the domino effect that occurs when women try to raise children, babies and toddlers in particular, and pursue full-time career simultaneously. The subtitle of the book (which has since been re-released as \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Parents Are Choosing to Stay Home\u201d ) was \u201cWhy Children and Most Careers Just Don\u2019t Mix,\u201d and its overall message was that the needs and demands of children are so great that to try and meet those needs and demands after being spent from a day at the office is fruitless. What\u2019s more, it yanks the joy of motherhood right out of you.\n\nI wrote that book to help women who\u2019ve been taught to map out their futures without giving any thought at all to how their lives will change down the road when they become mothers. Not only are women surprised to find out how taxing motherhood is, they don\u2019t anticipate how much they\u2019d want to be with their babies.\n\nNeedless to say, I was lambasted in the media for daring to write a book that outlined the costs of working motherhood. But fifteen years later, the results are in.\n\nA new report by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that women today \u201cfrequently underestimate the time, money and effort it takes to raise children and have a career at the same time, leading many to invest in their skills and then reluctantly leave the workforce when the true costs of being a working mother become apparent,\u201d writes Lauren Weber at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDespite this reality, the message isn\u2019t getting across to younger women. According to the NBER report, female high school seniors \u201care increasingly and substantially overestimating the likelihood they will be in the labor market in their thirties.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s a logical follow-up question: Why don\u2019t young women understand what children, babies in particular, need? And why do they assume they\u2019ll be just as career-driven in their thirties as they were in their twenties?\n\nI\u2019ll answer those questions with two more questions: Why wouldn\u2019t modern women be in the dark about motherhood? And why wouldn\u2019t they assume they\u2019d never leave the workforce?\n\nSince the day they were born, college-bound women have been groomed for a life at the office rather than for a life at home. No one told them their priorities will shift down the line. No one told them how overwhelming motherhood is without a career, let alone with one. Most importantly, no one told them how joyful motherhood can be.\n\nIn previous generations, women embraced this transformation and viewed marriage and family not just as the center of their lives but as the purpose of life. Modern women, by contrast, view a career as their life\u2019s purpose and assume they can squeeze marriage and family in around this otherwise more pressing endeavor \u2013 if they squeeze it in at all.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that by the time the average woman hits 30, the likelihood of her deciding that marriage and motherhood, not career, is the most important thing in her life is astronomically high. Too many women needlessly wind up in a quandary when they become mothers. Many are shocked to discover that what they thought was important before they had children feels utterly irrelevant afterward.\n\nIf we know this to be true, why don\u2019t we help young women better prepare for their futures? Why should young women map out their lives as though husbands and babies aren\u2019t going to come along and happily put a wrench in those plans? Why don\u2019t we change the question and ask not what motherhood\u2019s effect on employment will be but what effect employment will have on a woman when she becomes a mother?\n\nOf course the culture will never ask this question, so it\u2019s up to parents to circumvent the narrative their daughters will invariably receive. I have a daughter who\u2019s headed off to college in the fall, and like most girls she plans to get married and have children someday. Great, I told her. Here are three important things you need to know:\n\n1. Whom you choose to marry will have more effect on your happiness and well-being than any other choice you make in life. So make sure you focus at least as much on getting that decision right as you do on nailing down a career.\n\n2. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll always be in the workforce. Trying to juggle full-time work while raising babies isn\u2019t just stressful, it\u2019s unfair to your yet-to-be-born children. Babies have needs that must be met, and a mother is in the best position to meet those needs. The attempt to \u2018have it all\u2019 is futile. Something always suffers, and it\u2019s usually the kids \u2013 as Indra K. Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, courageously admitted in 2014. Knowing this in advance can help you make smart decisions in life and in love.\n\n3. Don\u2019t forget that your body has an agenda of its own. You have a window with which to conceive children the natural way. If you put motherhood off too long, you invite unnecessary hardship \u2013 physically, financially and psychologically \u2013 into your life. For most women, this is completely avoidable.\n\nThat women today are unprepared for motherhood isn\u2019t the least bit surprising. But the onus is on their parents and the culture, who insisted that women focus on their educations and careers to the exclusion of everything else. \u201cIf I could go back ten years,\u201d Rachel Lehmann-Haupt writes in \u201cThe Aniston Syndrome,\u201d \u201cI would tell my younger self that she should deeply consider her future family\u2026I wonder whether in fact my generation collectively screwed up.\u201d\n\nIndeed."

Boise Police Chief William Bones said Sunday that while the suspect is an American, investigators have not found any evidence that would indicate the attack was a hate crime. Still, Bones said, it is one of several possibilities that remain under investigation.\n\nTimmy Kinner showed up late Saturday at the complex, which houses many resettled refugee families in Boise. Kinner, who is not a refugee, targeted the party that was held a few doors down from the apartment where he had stayed for a short time, police said.\n\n\"This incident is not a representation of our community but a single evil individual who attacked people without provocation that we are aware of at this time,\" Police Chief William Bones said Sunday.\n\nThe victims included the 3-year-old birthday girl and five other children ages 4 to 12. Three adults who came to their defense were also hurt. Some were gravely wounded, Bones said.\n\nA resident of the complex had recently met Kinner, who was new to the area and needed a place to stay, Bones said.\n\n\"I believe her perception was, 'Here's a helping hand I can give in return for a helping hand I have been given,'\" Bones said.\n\nThe resident asked Kinner to leave Friday when his behavior became a problem, and he did so peacefully, Bones said. The police chief did not elaborate on his behavior. The woman was not among the victims.\n\nEsrom Habte, 12, and Fathi Mahamoud, 11, were playing in the grass behind their apartment when the attack began. They saw the suspect chasing people.\n\n\"We saw him saying, like, bad words and stabbing a kid and a grown-up and really hard and a lot of times,\" Esrom said.\n\nThe two ran into an apartment and hid in a closet with other children until police told them it was safe to come out, he said.\n\n\"I saw the police cleaning stuff, and then I came outside,\" Fathi said. He said the stabbing victims included three families, all of them friends.\n\nKinner, 30, was arrested near the scene and charged with aggravated battery and of injury to a child. Investigators recovered the knife he was believed to have used in a nearby canal, Bones said.\n\nThe attack resulted in the most victims in a single incident in Boise Police Department history, the police chief said.\n\n\"The crime scene, the faces of the parents struggling, the tears coming down their faces, the faces of the children in their hospital beds will be something that I carry with me for the rest of my life, as will every first responder that night,\" he said.\n\nThe apartment complex is just off of one of Boise's busier streets, separated from the traffic by one of the many irrigation canals that run through the city. On Sunday, colorful bouquets had been placed just outside crime-scene tape.\n\nResidents of the apartments and the rest of the community were \"reeling\" from the violence, Bones said, and will need long-term community support.\n\n\"This isn't something that gets over in the days or weeks that follow. ... The level of the some of the injuries will be life-altering in a very negative way,\" Bones said.\n\nMayor Dave Bieter condemned the stabbings on Twitter.\n\n\"Last night's horrific attack does not represent Boise,\" Bieter wrote. \"Please join me in praying for the injured and their families. We must come together to condemn this vile act.\"\n\nMegan Schwab, who works with the International Rescue Committee in Boise, said the organization was working to provide temporary housing, counseling and other support to those affected by the attack.\n\nFor some of the refugees living at the complex, the attack revived traumatic memories of the war and violence they had fled. The blood from the stabbings reminded residents Ibod Hasn and Thado Aip of the terror they left in Somalia, they said on Sunday.\n\nAip's son, Fathi Mahamoud, stayed close by her side Sunday, at times sitting on the grass to lean against her legs as he watched the police at the crime scene.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Collin Binkley in Boston contributed to this report."

Dpa reported that Alexander Dobrindt, the leader of the CSU in parliament, told others Seehofer could not be allowed to resign.\n\n\n\nIf Seehofer does step down, it was not immediately clear what effect the move would have on a three-week impasse between Merkel and her Bavarian-only CSU partners, which has centered on his resolve to turn away some types of asylum-seekers at Germany's borders.\n\n\n\nMerkel has insisted on Europe-wide solutions to handling the waves of desperate foreigners trying to reach the continent and the standoff could spell the end of her fourth government.\n\n\n\nMerkel insisted earlier Sunday that a plan to regulate immigration European Union leaders approved Friday and agreements she hashed out with several key countries would accomplish what Seehofer seeks.\n\n\n\n\"The sum total of everything we have agreed upon has the same effect\" as what Seehofer has demanded, Merkel said in an interview with ZDF television. \"That is my personal opinion. The CSU must naturally decide that for itself.\"\n\n\n\nBut dpa reported that Seehofer told the forum he thinks the measures do not adequately accomplish his goals.\n\n\n\nAs the CSU met in Munich, Merkel's Christian Democrats met in Berlin to discuss what comes next.\n\n\n\nSeehofer, whose party faces a state election in the fall, has threatened to turn away at the borders migrants whose asylum requests Germany already rejected or who already sought asylum elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\n\nMerkel has rejected that approach, saying Germany needs to address migration more broadly to preserve EU unity. If Seehofer goes ahead with his policies, the dispute could end the decades-old conservative alliance between the CSU and Merkel's CDU.\n\n\n\nMerkel and Seehofer met Saturday night for two hours. The German leader would not comment Sunday on the outcome of the talks. She also would not speculate on whether she might fire him or if the issue could lead to a government confidence vote in parliament.\n\n\n\nShe said she would wait and see what the leadership of the two parties decides \"and then we will see what comes next, step for step.\"\n\n\n\nMerkel reiterated her position that if countries start turning migrants away at national borders unilaterally, it would cause neighboring countries to close their borders and jeopardize the border-free movement the Europe's so-called Schengen-zone.\n\n\n\nShe said the decision by leaders of European Union countries Friday to strengthen the 28-nation bloc's exterior borders and her proposal for \"anchor centers\" to process migrants at Germany's borders would work better.\n\n\n\n\"I want Europe to remain together,\" she said. \"That is why the unified action of Europe is so important to me.\"\n\n\n\nMerkel also secured agreement from Greece and Spain to take back from Germany migrants who previously registered in those countries. She said 14 other nations had given verbal assent to work toward similar deals."

Today, Seattle is booming again with housing prices skyrocketing thanks to online retail giant Amazon's explosive growth that has added tens of thousands of well-paid workers to the area.\n\nBezos has been a flashpoint in the tension that has come with success. The City Council recently passed \u2014 then quickly rescinded \u2014 a tax on large employers to combat homelessness, which Amazon opposed and successfully worked to strike down. A city councilwoman organized protests in front of Amazon buildings featuring people carrying \"Tax Bezos\" signs.\n\nMeanwhile, Gates has largely escaped the criticism directed at Bezos and other tech leaders as Seattle loudly debates how to respond to the advantages and downsides of being the United States' fastest-growing big city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObservers say Gates benefits from being a local and the world's leading philanthropist.\n\nMargaret O'Mara, a historian and University of Washington professor, said Gates came from a prominent Seattle family, arising in the public eye at a time when there was less anxiety about online privacy.\n\n\"It's a really, really different public persona,\" O'Mara said. \"He recognized the importance of this responsibility, this broader civic responsibility, that he had great power to be incredibly influential, to deploy his intellect and persuasive powers for good.\"\n\nEarly on, there was some criticism that Gates and his company could be better corporate citizens as Microsoft blossomed. But thanks to the billions he now gives away each year, Gates has managed to shed his reputation as a laser-focused, sharp-elbowed tech billionaire, though his controversial philanthropic work focused on changing America's school systems hasn't gone unnoticed at home.\n\nMicrosoft has been headquartered in Seattle's once-sleepy eastern suburbs since 1979. The company is seen as the game-changer that allowed the region to shed its infamous \"Boeing Bust\" 1970s-era recession when the aircraft manufacturer laid of tens of thousands of workers during an economic slump.\n\nAmazon is far more visible near downtown since starting as an online book-seller in 1994. It emerged as one of the success stories from the 1990s dot-com boom and is now the city's largest private employer with more than 45,000 workers. Bezos, who grew up in Houston, moved to Seattle to launch his startup in part because of Washington state's favorable tax structure.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on Bezos' behalf.\n\nBezos \u2014 who in the past year surpassed Gates as the world's richest person \u2014 recently hinted he too would take on philanthropy in a big way. He said on Twitter that he would announce his plans later this year. Locally, Bezos has been on the board of the Bezos Family Foundation that is run by his parents, which focuses on education nationally.\n\nIn January, Bezos also personally gave $33 million in college scholarships for young immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. He hasn't signed The Giving Pledge, an initiative launched by Gates encouraging billionaires to commit to giving away most of their wealth.\n\nWhere Bezos has been criticized for not being present enough, Gates' nonprofit since 2000 has dedicated resources to helping local community issues. Food banks and domestic violence victims' assistance are among the modestly funded and lesser-known work of the powerful, globally focused Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates is also credited with delivering a Washington state charter school law through campaign contributions and his foundation's support of the movement.\n\nDavid Bley, who leads the foundations' Pacific Northwest unit, said his team is the only one that functions in a more typical family foundation fashion by giving to local causes.\n\nOfficially, just 1.5 percent \u2014 or almost $70 million \u2014 of the $4.6 billion the foundation gave away in 2016 benefited the needy in the Puget Sound region and Washington state, according to the foundation's annual report.\n\nThe Gates Foundation estimates it contributed $1.5 billion into the Seattle economy in 2015. It reports supporting 9,100 local jobs, including 1,200 people at the foundation itself and many more at Seattle-based organizations doing global work. For example, it gave about $270 million to six local organizations in one four-year span as part of its goal to eradicate malaria worldwide, which in turn fuels Seattle's biotech and health research sector.\n\nStill, Gates is not without local critics. One thing the hometown hero can't escape is his national reputation as the leading funder of U.S. education reform. Some of the controversial ideas he's prioritized have floundered in the state over the years.\n\nWashington state defied federal authority when it refused in 2014 to use test scores in teacher evaluations. The concept of tying teacher performance to student test scores was part of a signature Gates initiative but was vehemently opposed by teacher unions.\n\nGates also gave millions to pass a state charter school law after it failed three times at the ballot. He's had a hand in supporting each of the state's 12 privately run, publicly funded schools even though the law is still being challenged in the courts after its narrow 2012 approval.\n\n\"Teaching in the shadow of Bill Gates is, I think, a very ominous experience because we know that his foundation is organized around the principal of privatizing our schools, of getting rid of the very institutions that we're working in,\" said Jesse Hagopian, a Seattle high school teacher and Gates critic.\n\nTeachers have also protested at the foundation's Seattle headquarters over his national schools agenda. The Gates Foundation has said it has an \"up-and-down\" relationship with Seattle Public Schools. The district wouldn't comment on the matter.\n\nThe foundation said it's unapologetic about the urgency it feels is needed to transform school systems that consistently leave behind poor and minority kids.\n\n\"We're a funder. We're not government. They have way more money. They have authority,\" Bley said. \"We only have influence and catalytic amounts of money to help people try out new things.\""

Rumors of another vacancy have reverberated across Washington for months; the decision comes a year after Kennedy's former law clerk Neil Gorsuch took over the seat occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDavid French, senior writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom joins Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss Justice Kennedy's legacy and possible replacements for him.\n\nOn career of Justice Kennedy: I think hes got the legacy of a man who had got no guiding judicial philosophy and so therefore, basically especially on really contentious issues ruled on what he thought was right. And when he was against you and when he was opposed to you it was infuriating because you felt like there no way to reason with him because there was no underlying judicial philosophy to appeal to. (1:10)\n\nOn rumor that there is a list of five finalists: Just to say about predicting, I've now had three different sources authoritatively tell me of three different frontrunners. You just don't know what to think. The three I have heard are Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Barrett and Mike Lee. I don't know if that's right. You know, what I've just told you is worthless. I don't have any knowledge if that's right. (3:14)\n\nOn the biggest issues the court will be deciding on in the coming years: Let me make it really broad and let me just say I think the key issue of the next decade is going to be the power of the state over the individual and that's going to play itself in ways that are interesting for liberals and conservatives in some ways. (5:40)\n\nOn if this will impact the midterms: I think this would help galvanize the Republican intensity. This is the way I put in a piece I wrote yesterday Republicans are all over the map on a lot of important issues. You mention the word Supreme Court and all of those differences dissolve and we're one. We're united. It gives Republicans this moment of unity. (14:10)\n\nWatch below:"

To ensure you receive conservative and faith-based news items \u2013 click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter.\n\nFor four days last April students at a Emmaus High School in Pennsylvania were forced to watch videos selected by the \u201cstudent-led\u201d Gay-Straight Alliance.\n\nThe videos ranged from \u201c9 Questions Gay People Have About Straight People\u201d to a compilation of clips celebrating \u201cmarriage equality.\u201d There was also a video educating students about gender fluidity \u2013 the idea there is no such thing as male or female.\n\n\u201cMy son expressed to me that he felt bullied by the administration for being a heterosexual man and being forced to listen to LGBT advocacy on a daily basis,\u201d one parent wrote in a letter to the school district.\n\nThe East Penn School District claimed the videos, shown during daily announcements, were about anti-bullying and the LGBT movement. But parents argue it was more about indoctrination. And when they asked to see the videos \u2013 the school district refused.\n\n\u201cThis is a gross violation of parental rights,\u201d Liberty Counsel attorney Richard Mast wrote in a June 22 letter to Supt. Michael Schilder.\n\nLiberty Counsel, a law firm that specializes in First Amendment and religious liberty issues, is calling on the district to immediately release what they called \u201cfour pro-homosexuality\u201d videos shown as part of the district\u2019s \u201cUnity Week\u201d and \u201cDay of Silence\u201d activities.\n\n\u201cIt does not pass the straight face test for the District to claim it need not provide parents with the actual video links, although the District required more than 2,800 students to view these videos, with no prior notice to parents, and no opportunity to opt-out,\u201d Mast wrote.\n\nParents took their concerns to the school district \u2013 but they were rebuffed.\n\n\u201cSince when does a public school in the United States of America have the right to block a parent and tell them they will not allow them to see the controversial partisan programming they are requiring their children to watch,\u201d another parent asked in a letter to the district. \u201cWe have every right to expect that our children are not being subjected to partisan indoctrination in our public schools.\u201d\n\nSupt. Michael Schilder said the video presentations were compiled by the school\u2019s Gay-Straight Alliance as part of a student project and are therefore off limits to parents.\n\n\u201cStudent work and student expression must always be protected,\u201d he told The Morning Call. \u201cA parent or member of the public has no right to view or access a student\u2019s term paper, speech, or multimedia project just because he or she objects to the topic.\u201d\n\nParents said they were told they had absolutely no say in what their children were being exposed to at the school house.\n\nI was told by the superintendent (that) parents have no right to view these videos,\u201d one person said in documents provided by Liberty Counsel. \u201cI would appreciate knowing why I was not afforded the opportunity to opt my son out of this targeted, planned, social engineering.\u201d\n\nLGBT activists have accused the moms and dads of being homophobic and anti-gay. However, parents say the core issue is about whether parents have the right to know what their children are being taught.\n\n\u201cFor the record, neither Liberty Counsel nor parents who have contacted us object to the District promoting kindness amongst students or fighting actual bullying where it exists or promoting a \u2018Unity Week\u2019 that does not delve into matters of sexuality,\u201d Mast wrote in his letter to the superintendent.\n\nLiberty Counsel is threatening legal action unless the school district provides the videos to parents.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that parents, not agents of the state, including teachers, and certainly not GLSEN or its teacher or student affiliates with the GSA, have the right to direct the upbringing and associations of minor children,\u201d Mast wrote.\n\nIt does make you wonder why the school district does not want parents to know what was shown to the children. Why the secrecy?\n\nLiberty Counsel president Mat Staver told the Todd Starnes Radio show there is no doubt the school district is trying to indoctrinate students.\n\n\u201cIt is troubling that the school district intentionally hides its LGBT indoctrination from the parents,\u201d Staver said. \u201cThe school district has harmed students with its radical LGBT propaganda.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Facebook is cracking down on Conservative content.

While its second weekend drop is about 10 percent steeper than that of the first film, worldwide, the film has grossed $932.4 million to date and is barreling toward the $1 billion mark.\n\nThe dinosaurs didn't gobble up all the attention this weekend, however. \"Incredibles 2,\" now in its third weekend in theaters, took second place with $45.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $439.7 million.\n\nNorth American audiences came out in larger than expected numbers for both the action thriller \"Sicario: Day of the Soldado\" and \"Uncle Drew.\"\n\nThe \"Sicario\" sequel starring Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro earned $19 million to take third place. The film, distributed by Sony Pictures, cost a reported $35 to $40 million to produce.\n\nLanding in fourth place was the basketball comedy \"Uncle Drew,\" which features NBA All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Shaquille O'Neal. With a production price tag under $20 million, the film exceeded expectations grossing $15.5 million and got audience stamp of approval with an A CinemaScore.\n\nThe ad and marketing campaign included spots during the NBA playoffs and finals, a Wheaties box featuring Irving as Uncle Drew, and an Uncle Drew capsule collection from Nike.\n\nLionsgate, which distributed the movie, knew the film had built-in marketability because of the celebrity of the stars, but was also pleased to discover that the film in early screenings appealed to non-basketball fans too.\n\n\"That was the surprise, that wow, we have a picture that really plays to a general audience,\" said David Spitz, Lionsgate's president of domestic distribution. \"It has a really sweet message.\"\n\nThe A CinemaScore, which suggests that the film will have good word-of-mouth buzz, could bode well for the film over the Fourth of July holiday and into the rest of the summer.\n\n\"We're hoping it's the old adage, 'It's not a sprint, it's a marathon,'\" Spitz said.\n\nLower down on the charts the Indian film \"Sanju,\" a biopic about Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, earned an impressive $2.6 million from only 356 screens in its opening weekend. And the Fred Rogers documentary \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" now playing on 654 screens, continues to do well in its expansion. It added $2.3 million to its earnings this weekend.\n\nAfter two weekends of $100 million plus movies, this past weekend provided a little blockbuster break before \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" opens this week. But even without a record-breaker or a $100 million movie, the box office is still up 15.3 percent from last summer's abysmal performance and 9.3 percent for the year overall.\n\n\"We can't have every weekend like the last two weekends,\" said comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.\n\n\"The theatrical box office is on a major roll right now,\" Dergarabedian added. \"This puts to bed any notion that the summer movie season has run its course. Audiences want to go out to the movie theater during the summer season.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,\" $60 million ($56.1 million international).\n\n2. \"Incredibles 2,\" $45.5 million ($44.3 million international).\n\n3. \"Sicario: Day of the Soldado,\" $19 million ($8.4 million international).\n\n4. \"Uncle Drew,\" $15.5 million.\n\n5. \"Ocean's 8,\" $8 million ($13.8 million international).\n\n6. \"Tag,\" $5.6 million ($3.7 million international).\n\n7. \"Deadpool 2,\" $3.5 million ($2.8 million international).\n\n8. \"Sanju,\" $2.6 million ($22.2 million international).\n\n9. \"Solo: A Star Wars Story,\" $2.3 million ($6.1 million international).\n\n10. \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" $2.3 million."

Paramedics and school staff unsuccessfully attempted CPR.\n\nPHOTO CAPTURES MOMENT TODDLER'S LEG BROKE WHILE ON SLIDE WITH MOM\n\nNow, more than a year later, the BC Coroners Service confirmed a strain of staphylococcus aureus on a tampon, as well as other symptoms consistent with TSS, were discovered, CTV News reported. TSS is a dangerous, sometimes fatal illness caused by bacterial toxins. It\u2019s primarily linked to menstruating women who use super-absorbent tampons, but the infection can affect people of all ages, including men, children and postmenopausal women.\n\n\u201cWe know there is an association,\u201d Dee Hoyano, Island Health Medical officer, told CTV Vancouver Island. \u201cCertainly we know a person needs to have this particular bacteria to get sick, and then there may be something with tampon use, maybe prolonged tampon use, that puts that risk higher for developing a more widespread infection.\u201d\n\nManitoski\u2019s sister, Carli Manitoski, took to Facebook to warn about TSS in December.\n\nMAN WITNESSES DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE DAY BEFORE CANCER DEATH\n\n\u201cAfter 9 agonizing months we have finally got confirmation that my litter sister passed away from Toxic Shock Syndrome or (TSS).

Because they\u2019re going to get beaten so badly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they\u2019re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones \u2013 you get rid of ICE you\u2019re going to have a country that you\u2019re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that issue if they're going to actually do that,\u201d he added.\n\nCalls to \u201cabolish ICE,\u201d once limited to the far-left parts of the Democratic Party base, have shifted into the mainstream mostly in response to the Trump administration\u2019s tough policies on illegal immigration -- particularly the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on detaining all illegal border crossers.\n\nIn New York, far-left primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocked the party\u2019s establishment by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. In the days after, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio have added their support to the cause.\n\n'ABOLISH ICE' GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS\n\n\"I believe that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has become a deportation force \u2026 and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,\" Gillibrand said in a CNN interview Thursday night.\n\n\u201cWe should abolish ICE,\u201d de Blasio said Friday morning on WNYC radio. His Democratic colleague in Albany, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is also facing pressure to back such calls after primary challenger Cynthia Nixon has called ICE a \"terrorist organization.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif has said that the U.S. should consider \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d while Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., announced on Monday that he would be introducing a bill to abolish the agency.\n\nBut, while it was unlikely to gain much traction on the right, Trump also tweeted on Saturday that he was backing ICE agents and that there was \u201czero chance\u201d of ICE being abolished.\n\n\u201cTo the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,\u201d he said. \u201cSo brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!\u201d\n\nTrump is joining a number of Republicans and immigration hardliners who are welcoming the Democratic shift on the issue, believing that it spells electoral victory for the GOP outside of Democratic enclaves like New York and California.\n\n\"Based on the last week, Democrats apparently want to campaign on open borders, mass migration, & abolishing ICE,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted this week. \"Give them points for honesty. Let's vote.\""

Then they won\u2019t be separated. Pretty simple.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Final Thoughts.\n\nYou should know that the U.N. group that slammed the U.S. border policy includes some of the world\u2019s most repressive countries and regimes. So, for starters, maybe they should focus on their own horrid human rights records.\n\nNonetheless, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told reporters this week \"the U.S. should immediately halt this practice of separating families and stop criminalizing what should at most be an administrative offense.\u201d She went on to say the practice \u201camounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life.\u201d\n\nTomi Lahren on CA: The Golden State Is 'Turning Into a Golden Disaster'\n\nTomi Lahren: Trump Supporters Should Not Justify Roseanne's 'Indefensible' Tweet\n\nExcuse me?! Let me get this straight. The U.S. should stop protecting our borders because it\u2019s a hindrance to the illegal immigrants' family life?! What about American families - families that rely on safe and secure borders? Don't we matter?\n\nNo one likes the idea of separating children from their families. And the best way to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen is to keep people - of ALL ages - from crossing the border ILLEGALLY!\n\nHello! Why is this such a hard concept to understand?!\n\nIt's not just the U.N. The ACLU has also filed a lawsuit on the family separations.\n\nBut the Trump administration has made it clear: We have a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for illegal border crossings. That\u2019s not mean. That\u2019s not inhumane. That\u2019s BORDER ENFORCEMENT.\n\nYou\u2019d think the Democrats would understand that. They rarely meet regulations they don\u2019t like. Why are border and immigration regulations any different?\n\nImagine if they spent half as much time focusing on border security as they do gun safety? Perhaps we wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament.\n\nTake the case of the pizza delivery man from New York who was detained last week at a military base, and now faces deportation. Many of us feel tremendous compassion for the man, Pablo Villavicencio. But he defied a voluntary departure order in 2010, and was therefore considered \u201can ICE fugitive.\u201d\n\nNo one wants to see him taken away from his family, and deported back to Ecuador. But how are we to handle this crisis if we keep bending the rules? As much as I feel for that family, I also feel for the thousands of immigrant families who spend time and money to do it the right way.\n\nWe all agree we need immigration reform. But instead of aiding, abetting and applauding illegal immigrants, how about we send the message, loud and clear, \u201cOUR BORDER WILL BE ENFORCED.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t journey through Mexico with your children. Don\u2019t put yourselves at risk. And don\u2019t blame the United States or President Trump when you get here and are detained or prosecuted.\n\nEvery nation has the right to enforce its borders. Why do some believe the U.S. should be any different? Yes, we're a nation of immigrants - but we're also one of laws. Get with the program, or face the consequences.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts. Feel free to disagree. From LA, God Bless and take care.\n\nTomi Lahren: Take a Moment to Remember What Memorial Day Is Really About\n\nTomi Lahren on New NFL Anthem Policy: Americans Used Their Remotes and Made a Difference"

But for a planet whose atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide, how will humans do something as simple as breathe, much less live?\n\nSpeaking with Fox News, Aldrin said there may be feasibility to ideas put forth by tech luminaries such as Elon Musk (a friend of Aldrin's), including detonating nuclear weapons as a way to 'terraform' the Red Planet or transforming Mars so it can support human life.\n\n\"Well, he\u2019s not the only one who's pioneered ideas like that,\" Aldrin said in an interview with Fox News. \"He\u2019s a little more flowery with things he does, but there's also Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, the latter of whom I have great admiration for and the slow steady way he\u2019s limiting himself to lunar industry that will then enable the same for thousands and millions of people.\"\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN:HOW WE CAN MAKE MARS MISSIONS A REALITY\n\nThe 88-year-old Aldrin went on to say that much of humanity knows we need to get to space to survive, even if the cost for expansion into space is currently, pun intended, astronomical.\n\n\"There's this thing up there called the moon, and it\u2019s caught our fancy,\" the former astronaut and Command Pilot in the United States Air Force said. \"And it\u2019s time to begin to exercise what we\u2019ve learned in a way that we can do at the moon, and share the cost - very important. The U.S. can\u2019t pay for all of this, we've got to share the costs and share the benefits so that we directly contribute to just what we are able to do.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And its gonna be much greater than two guys for one day, there months later, something like that. We\u2019re gonna occupy the moon, and we\u2019re going to think about occupying but, I think we\u2019re going to settle Mars.\"\n\nAldrin has previously told Fox News he believes astronauts could land on Mars by 2040.\n\nThe Apollo 11 astronaut is in the spotlight at the moment after filing a lawsuit against two of his children over control of his estate and space artifacts.\n\nDrop a bomb\n\nIn 2015, speaking with \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert, Musk said that terraforming Mars could be done by dropping thermonuclear bombs on the poles or releasing greenhouse gases to warm up the planet. Colbert joked that Musk might be a super-villain.\n\nOthers have come up with more conventional ideas, including NASA, which proposed launching an enormous magnetic shield into space to protect the planet from solar winds in a 2017 paper.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN REMINDS US HE TOOK THE FIRST SPACE SELFIE ON #NATIONALSELFIEDAY\n\n\"The magnetic field direction could also maintain an orientation that keeps it parallel with the impinging solar wind interplanetary field thereby significantly reducing mass, momentum, and energy flow into the magnetosphere and thus also damping internal magnetospheric dynamics,\" the NASA paper reads.\n\n\"This situation then eliminates many of the solar wind erosion processes that occur with the planet\u2019s ionosphere and upper atmosphere allowing the Martian atmosphere to grow in pressure and temperature over time.\"\n\nNASA has also proposed making oxygen from Mars' atmosphere, using an experiment known as MOXIE, which would involve converting the enormous amounts of carbon dioxide found in the Red Planet's atmosphere.\n\nLife on Mars?\n\nMars' atmosphere is 95.97 percent carbon dioxide, 1.89 percent nitrogen, 1.93 percent argon, 0.0557 percent carbon monoxide and just 0.146 percent oxygen.\n\nBy comparison, Earth's atmosphere is made up nitrogen (78.09 percent), oxygen (20.95 percent), argon (0.93 percent), carbon dioxide (0.04 percent) and small amounts of other gases.\n\nNASA UNVEILS BOLD NEW PLAN TO PROTECT EARTH FROM ASTEROIDS\n\nIt will be years, perhaps even hundreds of years, before Mars is made habitable for humans. No matter how it's done, Aldrin believes now is the time to capitalize on humanity's interest and make it a reality.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to take a lot of analysis, a lot of weighing the option, about how significant this is to excite the public and treating the crews,\" Aldrin said. \"Of course there is a great economic benefit of going up but [also] pay the cost of bringing people back.\"\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia"

Wade would not be acceptable to me because that would indicate an activist agenda that I don't want to see a judge have,\" Collins said.\n\nCollins did not elaborate on specific judges she had ruled out. The Los Angeles Times recently claimed, inaccurately, that one top candidate on Trump's list, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, wrote in a 2003 academic publication that Roe v. Wade was \"erroneous.\"\n\nBarrett, the former Notre Dame law professor who Trump recently appointed to the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit, has often spoken about her Catholic faith.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearings last year, Senate Democrats were widely criticized for grilling Barrett on her Catholic faith, despite her insistence that she would not \"impose\" her personal convictions on the law.\n\nWATCH: DEMS TAKE HEAT AFTER GRILLING NOMINEE FOR CATHOLIC FAITH\n\nJustice Kennedy largely voted with the Supreme Court's liberal bloc on abortion rights, even as he sided with conservatives on other key issues.\n\nPresident Trump said on Fox News on Sunday that he expects his next Supreme Court pick \u201cto go very quickly.\" The president added that he's unlikely to ask his nominee\u2019s position on the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion rights case -- which Collins said the president had also told her, as well.\n\n\u201cThe president told me in our meeting that he would not ask that question,\u201d Collins said in a separate interview on CNN.\n\nTrump said abortion rights \"could very well end up\" being determined on a state-by-state basis after a new Supreme Court justice is seated, but the president said he \"probably\" would not ask his pick to replace Kennedy how they would vote on Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m putting conservative people on,\u201d Trump said."

			"text": "Americans love dogs. As a nation, we own approximately 80 million and acquire another 1 million each year.\n\nAnyone who has stared into the beseeching eyes of a pup who wants nothing more than to pass time on a welcoming lap or have her ears gently scratched knows that these are far more than cherished pets. They are family members.\n\nThey should be a source of joy \u2013 not of danger. But what many people don\u2019t realize is a new danger associated with pets that are misleadingly labelled as \u201crescues.\u201d\n\nUnscrupulous distributors take advantage of Americans\u2019 well-known love for dogs and their empathy for an underdog. As a result, the United States has become a dumping ground for foreign \u201cpuppy mill\u201d and \u201crescue\u201d dogs. We import an estimated 1 million dogs annually from Turkey, several countries in the Middle East and as far away as China and Korea, according to the National Animal Interest Alliance.\n\nHistorically, rescue groups were run by committed breeders or kennel clubs that carefully vetted a small number of dogs and matched them with appropriate homes. But with the popularity of the \u201cadopt don\u2019t shop movement,\u201d the sale of large numbers of random-source dogs deceptively labelled as \u201crescue pets\u201d has become a big business.\n\nIn 2016 some 44 percent of dog owners adopted their pet from a shelter, rescue, humane society or public adoption event.\n\nWhile rescues can still be a good choice for pet owners willing to do their homework, the bottom line is that there\u2019s a risk with selecting a pet designated as a rescue animal.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if a rescue dog was legitimately in need of re-homing, bred for the retail rescue market or a random-source foreign animal imported en masse. And without records on origin and health, chances increase it could have serious temperament issues and be carrying serious diseases.\n\nA big part of the problem is the validity of health records for imported dogs. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health certificates required for entry into the U.S. are often invalid or forged. What\u2019s more, dogs from other countries are not subject to the same health and welfare laws as professionally bred U.S. dogs and may arrive carrying serious and infectious canine diseases.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that in conjunction with a surge in dog imports, the United States has experienced an increase in instances of dogs with rabies \u2013 including the canine variant that had previously been thought eradicated here \u2013 canine flu, screwworm, brucellosis and a variety of other infectious diseases directly related to irresponsibly imported pets.\n\nThe dynamic of importing potentially sick animals and exposing others is compounded by risky measures at the state level that force consumers to choose dogs identified as rescues or from random sources.\n\nFor example, so-called \u201cpuppy mill\u201d legislation passed in 2017 in California eliminates the sale of dogs sourced from regulated professional breeders in pet shops throughout the state. Instead, pet stores are forced to sell only those animals obtained through shelters or so-called rescues.\n\nLimiting the sale of pets from regulated professionals in favor of so-called rescues creates a perverse incentive to import greater numbers of street dogs and dogs of unknown origin for U.S. pet suppliers.\n\nThe importation of dogs now has the attention of U.S. lawmakers. House and Senate committees recently approved measures requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide an estimate of the number of dogs annually imported into the country, along with an estimate of how many of them lack proper health paperwork. The proposals were added to the farm bill, which is currently moving through Congress.\n\nThe congressional proposals are a good start to understand the breadth of the dog importation danger, but more needs to be done to protect public health:\n\n\u00b7 The federal government should strengthen efforts to ensure that all dogs imported into the United States are fully immunized, and free of infection, parasites and contagious diseases.\n\n\u00b7 Imported dogs should be individually certified as such by a qualified veterinarian.\n\n\u00b7 No pet should be imported without an individual examination, valid veterinary certificate, and documentation regarding the source of the dog and the party responsible for it upon arrival into the United States.\n\n\u00b7 Perhaps most importantly, regulators at the state and federal levels should boost direct oversight of rescues and shelters.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled. Retail rescues comprise a large industry using marketing that emphasizes the feel-good aspect of choosing a dog from an unknown situation. This is in sharp contrast to more traditional approaches of acquiring a dog from a reputable breed rescue or a breeder that emphasizes known background, breed characteristics and purposeful breeding programs with valid paperwork attesting to the animal\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cDogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole,\u201d said wildlife photographer Roger Caras.\n\nThat sincere sentiment goes for a purposefully bred and raised Labrador retriever, German shepherd or pug as much as it does a rescue animal. Americans should have the choice."

I grew up a ballerina. I danced for 13 years and it was my favorite thing to do as a kid. Tap, jazz, ballet \u2013 you name it, I did it all! Hindsight is always 20/20, but if I could go back, I would have continued with ballet. I stopped dancing when I wanted to pursue other sports, which leads me to the next thing you may not know.\n\n2. Sports have always been huge in my life. I grew up going to every Philadelphia Flyers home game with my dad, and every year we went to the Flyers Wives Fight for Lives Carnival with my family. That's where this photo of me with my bother and cousin is from.\n\nThree years ago, in Aruba, where we vacation, I played golf for the first time with my dad. Since then, I've been hooked. My love of ballet as a kid is equivalent to my love of golf as an adult. My very first TV job was in sports, and ever since then, I've done both news and sports. I guess you can say sports is in my blood!\n\nBut probably the best thing to happen in my sports life was covering the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl parade this year in Philly \u2013 my dream come true!\n\n3. Sticking with the athletic theme, I'm super \"outdoorsy.\" I climbed Mt. Sinai in Egypt in 2009 with my brother.\n\nAnd a few years ago, I climbed the majority of a Grand Canyon trail down and back in one day. I had to scrap a few miles or I would have run out of daylight, but both of those accomplishments are things I will never forget... probably because I was in pain for days!\n\n4. My very first job was as a cashier at O'Neill's Food Market in Glenside, Pennsylvania. I proudly wore that green uniform! To this day, I have to have my bills facing the same way in my wallet and I still bag my own groceries.\n\nA year ago, I went back home to do a piece for \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to introduce me to the viewers, and I got back in that uniform like nothing changed!

			"text": "One in four Americans has failed a diet \u2014 because their partner led them astray, according to new research.\n\nA survey examining how and why our attempts to eat healthily and lose weight often fail found a surprisingly high number of diets come undone because of a partner leading us into temptation.\n\nFrom eating irresistible treats and snacks in front of us to ordering takeout or willing us to have drinks, responses showed 24 percent of people blame their partner for derailing a diet.\n\nThe results emerged from a survey conducted by OnePoll in conjunction with Isopure, which looked into the dieting successes and failures of 2,000 Americans.\n\nPICS: WOMAN SEEN DOING YOGA ON EDGE OF CRUMBLING CLIFF\n\nWith people mindful of their summer bodies, responses showed top reasons people fail diets are lack of time to meal plan, having treats around the holidays, social gatherings, treating themselves, and stress around work.\n\nEven though many reasons behind diet failures are legitimate, there are some that appear to be simply based on temptation.\n\nResponses showed that 38 percent of survey respondents failed on a diet because they couldn\u2019t resist a delicious treat.\n\nAnother 32 percent claim that healthy food is simply too expensive, and so their bank account causes them to reach for a less-than-healthy snack.\n\nReaching for a feel-good-food seems to be a common way for survey respondents \u2014 42 percent of them \u2014 to deal with their stress.\n\nWith all these diet fails, what foods are people choosing to indulge in? Pizza tops the list, followed by ice cream, chips and chocolate.\n\nCookies came in at number five followed by cake, burgers, candy, and cheese.\n\nVETERINARIAN SHARES ADVICE FOR KEEPING PETS HEALTHY, AND NOT TOO HUSKY, THIS SUMMER\n\n\u201cA diet plan is only good if you can realistically adhere to it, so it\u2019s key to structure the plan around your specific lifestyle and to build permissive indulgent moments into the plan, like a weekly programmed cheat meal on Saturday night when you know you\u2019ll be around friends and family\u201d says Jonathan Thompson, the general manager of Isopure. (Saturday is the day that a diet is most likely to come to a crashing halt for survey participants, SWNS reported.)\n\n\u201cHaving a diet plan that accounts for your particular social, work and exercise cadence turns a potential diet-derailing moment into a positive and programmed part of your diet that you can actually look forward to, and greatly multiplies your chances of staying on plan and achieving your goals.\u201d\n\nAfter breaking a diet, many also admit to feeling disappointed, frustrated, upset, annoyed and angry. As a result, it\u2019s no wonder that two in five survey respondents get fed up with clothes that no longer fit or look good.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than simply sticking to a diet that contributes to a healthy lifestyle \u2014 sleep, fitness and hydration are also important.\n\nWith sleep being such an integral part of a healthy lifestyle \u2014 the average American is struggling to get the proper amount of sleep a night- with six hours being the average.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just sleep that continues to halt Americans\u2019 attempts at getting healthy. 34 percent of survey respondents rarely or never even exercise at all.\n\nPoor food choices, lack of sleep, and skipping the gym are one thing, but 27 percent of survey respondents don\u2019t even know how much water they need to consume in a day to stay properly hydrated.\n\nAnd even of the people that are aware, 16 percent report to not being able to meet their daily water intake needs.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cWhen you dial in the synergistic pillars of nutrition, exercise, sleep and hydration great things happen. Think of each as the leg of the table. Remove even one leg and things can get out of balance,\u201d said Thompson.\n\nUnfortunately, after failing a diet, two in five survey respondents lack the motivation to pursue a healthy lifestyle."

The one of a picture of a mother and child, sitting on a beach, with the words \u201cyou have eighteen summers with your children. spend them wisely\u201d written across the top of a lovely sunset scene.\n\nSo, this is number fourteen for me, with him. And, according to that mother\u2019s warning on that sunset picture, I have exactly four summers left.\n\nThat puts a lot of pressure on a momma, you know?!\n\nWhat exactly does one do with her child, when she only has four summers left with him? How does one even choose to spend that time?\n\nI layed in bed this last week and thought about that question (obsessed over that question would be more accurate, perhaps.)\n\nWill we spend it hiking? swimming? adventuring? eating new foods? experiencing new places?\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, my mind also went to other places (because that\u2019s what happens when you go down a rabbit hole at 2am, of course).\n\nI want to be the one to take it all in with him. Every moment. Every laughter. Every new experience.\n\nBut what will he even want to do with me, his momma, in this, our fourteenth summer together? Will his teenage self even want to hang out with me? Go adventuring with me? Exploring with me? Or will the posse of teenage friends win out? Will they get to be the ones to spend his fourteenth summer with him?\n\nI mean, didn\u2019t they see the picture?! Don\u2019t they know that I only have four left?!\n\nI want to be the one to take it all in with him. Every moment. Every laughter. Every new experience.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, this rabbit hole of the trials and tribulations of our fourteenth summer together leads me to one thing: My fourteenth summer. My fourteenth summer with my mom. With my dad. With my two little sisters.\n\nAnd want to know what I remember from my fourteenth summer? The only thing I can remember from my fourteenth summer with them?\n\nLove. I can remember love.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Not the exact adventures. Not the fine details. Not what we ate, not where we traveled.\n\nI can remember love.\n\nSo, out of the rabbit hole of 2am thoughts I climb. I dove in a distraught mother, and am proudly walking out a mother full of intention. Intent on how she wants to spend this, the fourteenth summer with her boy.\n\nShe will spend this summer loving him. That\u2019s it. Simple as that.\n\nSure, there will still be adventures \u2026 experiences \u2026 new food to eat \u2026 new places to explore.\n\nBut all of that will just be a bonus, really. A bonus to the love that will surround him daily. A bonus to the prayers that will be said for him daily. A bonus to the security that this, his home, will be for him daily.\n\nSo, mommas (and daddies, too), let\u2019s band together and do that, shall we? Whether you are in your third summer with your child, your ninth summer with your child \u2026 maybe your first summer, as you cradle that newborn baby in your arms, or even your last summer, as you watch that eighteen-year-old child of yours preparing himself or herself to spread those wings (the same wings that you\u2019ve spent so many seasons curating).\n\nLet\u2019s just spend this summer loving them.\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019ll ease some of the pressure of the holiday bucket list, and allow us to focus on the one thing that our little hearts want (and need) more than any grand summer adventure:\n\nAnd that would be our love."

FOX's Eben Brown reports:\n\nBULLET POINTS this week turns its attention to the Governor's Race in Florida, a state where the second amendment is politics for sure. It has again become so in the wake of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High earlier this year.\n\nPermits to carry concealed firearms in the Sunshine State (Florida Concealed Weapon or Firearm License, as it is properly called) are issued by the state's Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services. The state bureau is overseen by Commissioner Adam Putnam who also happens to be a frontrunner for the Republican nomination for Governor.\n\nPutnam flouts his NRA membership and his high marks from the organization. Under his tenure, Florida has issued more than one million Concealed Weapon or Firearm Licenses. But now the Tampa Bay Times newspaper alleges negligence, saying for a period of time Putnam's offices didn't bother background checking concealed-carry applicants when issuing those licenses.\n\n\"Inaccurate,\" says Putnam. \"Misleading.\"\n\nThe June 8th article notes the supposed negligence was during the same period of time in 2016 as the Pulse Nightclub terrorist attack, and that's when Florida issued more than 350,000 licenses.\n\nBULLET POINTS now examines the matter, with input from Putnam himself.\n\n\"I had an employee, who is no longer with me, who sat on 365 applications of the 350,000 that were processed,\" says Putnam. \"And as a result, 291 individuals who should not have had a concealed weapons license got one. We have revoked all of those licenses.\"\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times presented its information as if it uncovered a secret investigation. However, the Times doesn't tell its readers how the issue was found by Putnam.\n\n\"My office discovered the problem. I ordered the investigation.\"\n\nWhat's more is that the Tampa Bay Times fails to tell readers that a NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) search isn't the only check done on applicants. All applicants for a Florida CWF License have their fingerprints taken and checked against state and federal databases. Those checks never ceased.\n\nFurthermore, these licenses are not even needed to buy firearms, and they don't allow retail purchasers to skip NICS checks at the point of sale. Those NICS checks are performed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. A spokesperson for that agency tells BULLET POINTS that they never had problems accessing the NICS system. When asked if anybody made a retail purchase of a firearm in Florida without a NICS check, the spokesperson resoundingly answered, \"No!\"\n\nThe conclusion here is that even if a person was erroneously licensed to carry a concealed firearm, they would have gotten the same background check when they tried to purchase a gun. If the NICS check would have flagged them for the license application, it would have flagged them for the purchase. Now, a CWF license does allow the purchaser to skip the waiting period, which in Florida can be three to five days long. But the NICS check comes first.\n\nAs for the Pulse Nightclub gunman, he was already licensed at a higher tier due to his work as a security professional, vetted by the U.S. government to work courthouse security via a contractor. He also passed a NICS check when buying his firearm because he had no actionable record.\n\n\"This is a serious incident and I take it seriously,\" says Putnam. \"Which is what makes it so frustrating that the left-wing media is pushing a narrative that is much worse than the truth, even though they know better.\"\n\nA follow-up by the newspaper, published online June 11th, prints Putnam's defensive comments but not the legal mechanics behind obtaining the Florida license.\n\n\"I've demanded a correction,\" says Putnam.\n\nFollow Eben Brown on Twitter: @FOXEbenBrown"

Kirsten Gillibrand, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated longtime Democratic mainstay Joe Crowley in a New York primary \u2014 to abolish ICE.\n\nThe Trump administration has bolstered the agency\u2019s powers by executive order and adopted a controversial \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy regarding those who illegally migrate to America.\n\nTens of thousands took to the streets in protest against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown this weekend."

But the doctor maintains he did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nDr. Bob Sears, an outspoken critic of mandatory vaccinations, will be under scrutiny for 35 months following the decision by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe Orange County, Calif., pediatrician is accused of failing to obtain a detailed medical history before writing the 2014 letters, which he wrote after the 2-year-old\u2019s mother described the child's adverse reaction to an earlier vaccination, according to officials.\n\nThe doctor said it ended up taking more than a year to receive the boy's medical records, which would include the child\u2019s history of immunizations.\n\nSears said he took the boy\u2019s mother at her word when she said her son lost urinary function and \u201cwent limp\u201d in response to previous vaccinations, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\"Isn't it my job to listen to my patients and believe what a parent says happened to her baby? Isn't that what ALL doctors do with their patients?\u201d Sears wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cA patient's word is often the only evidence we have \u2014 as doctors we must trust our patients, the same way our patients trust us to look out for their best interest.\u201d\n\nHe said he agreed to a settlement with the state medical board, which was signed Wednesday, because \"it was likely that I'd get probation anyway,\" and to avoid going to trial, the report said.\n\n\u201cAfter all, I don\u2019t want a child to receive a medical treatment that could cause more harm. I am going to, first, do no harm, every time,\u201d he added in his post, alluding to a famous medical phrase.\n\nSears can continue to practice medicine, but will need to take an ethics class and 40 hours of medical education courses a year, the Times reported.\n\nDuring his probation period, he must also be monitored by another licensed doctor, the Orange County Register reported.\n\nThe board also requires Sears to notify all locations where he practices within seven days of the order going into effect July 27, according to the Register.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a trivial decision, it\u2019s not a slap on the hand,\u201d Dorit Reiss, a University of California, Hastings law professor, told the Times. \u201cIt really is strongly limiting his ability to practice. \u2026 He\u2019s a doctor under supervision now.\u201d\n\nRebecca Estepp, who is part of an advocacy group for alternative vaccine schedules, supports Sears.\n\n\u201cMany parents, myself included, are relieved that Dr. Sears will maintain his practice and continue to serve his patients that rely on him,\u201d Estepp told the Times.\n\nProbation is the most common punishment for doctors in California accused of wrongdoing.\n\nBut Sears said that the board had four additional cases pending against him.\n\n\u201cIt seems there is an attempt to keep me on probation for the rest of my medical career,\u201d Sears wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe state medical board took away 57 licenses, while putting 197 doctors on probation in the last fiscal year, according to the Times."

Roosevelt Library, shows the immense effort it took the President to walk just a few halting steps.\n\nRoosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921 at the age of 39, subsequently required leg braces and assistance to walk. His disability, however, was kept from the American public as the White House imposed strict rules on how he could be photographed or filmed. \u201cNo images of FDR in his wheelchair or being helped in and out of cars were permitted; no visual record was to be made of the arduous effort it took him to move just a few steps on his rigid braced legs,\u201d explained Geoffrey C. Ward, Roosevelt historian and Library Trustee, in a statement.\n\nEXTREMELY RARE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE PRINT GOES ON DISPLAY\n\nThe 1935 footage was captured during the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on April 22 of that year. The silent black-and-white film was shot by Frederick Hill, a Nevada rancher, who was attending the event with his wife and two children.\n\nArmed with his movie camera, Hill was apparently oblivious to the White House rules and pushed in behind a group of news cameramen to film FDR slowly walking along the mansion\u2019s portico. The smiling president leans on a cane in his right hand, while his left hand grips the arm of his bodyguard, Gus Gennerich.\n\n\u201cThe larger-than-usual crowd on the lawn that day may account for the fact that the Secret Service fails to see what Hill is doing; had they seen that he is filming the President in motion they would have asked him to hand over the camera and removed the film before handing it back,\u201d Ward noted.\n\nCIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD DISCOVERY: SURGEON'S BURIAL PIT REVEALS SOLDIERS' REMAINS, AMPUTATED LIMBS\n\nIn the film, Roosevelt grabs a railing with his left hand before waving to the massed crowds with his right hand. After greeting the crowd, FDR slowly makes his way back inside the White House, helped by Gennerich.\n\nThe architect of the New Deal and Commander-in-Chief during World War II, FDR is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.

The findings are clear: the suicide rate is constant.\n\nVeterans are more than twice as likely to die by suicide as non-veterans, according to the VA report. Additionally, VA researchers found the number of vets who take their own lives each day \u201cremained unchanged at 20.\u201d And even more-recent data obtained by Fox News suggests things may not be much better in 2018.\n\nEven for the mother of a U.S. Marine who took his own life after battling PTSD, and who has since dedicated her own to preventing veteran suicides, the numbers are stunning.\n\n\u201cI had no idea it was that bad,\u201d said Janine Lutz. \u201cThat\u2019s really lighting a fire under my butt to work harder.\"\n\nThe Veterans Crisis Line provides 24/7 support to veterans in distress, as well as concerned friends and family members. Staffers are available by phone at 800-273-8255 (Press 1), online at VeteransCrisisLine.net/Chat, and via text at 838255.\n\nThe volume of phone calls the Crisis Line receives is staggering. The VA told Fox News that since October 31, 2017, the Veterans Crisis Line has fielded approximately 222,000 calls from veterans who are having thoughts of suicide. That is in addition to the 49,000 calls from family members or friends who are concerned about a veteran who is considering suicide.\n\nThat breaks down to nearly 950 calls from veterans (or nearly 40 calls per hour) every day since Halloween, and more than 200 calls a day from friends and family.\n\n\"The mother of all battalions\"\n\nLutz, who lives in Florida, is affectionately referred to by many in the veterans' community as \u201cthe mother of all battalions\u201d for her efforts to bring veterans of all stripes together, and prevent more veteran suicides, via the LCpl Janos V Lutz Live To Tell Foundation.\n\nLutz started Live To Tell to honor the memory of her son \u201cJonny,\u201d a Marine who took his own life while under the influence of a cabinet\u2019s worth of medication for his PTSD. Since then, she has sued the government for her son\u2019s death, eventually winning a settlement out of court, but her work didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cAbout five months after [Jonny\u2019s] death, I woke up one day and I was mad,\u201d Lutz told Fox News. \u201cI was mad knowing that my son wasn't the first to die like this. And I said why didn't somebody tell me\u2026 why aren't we doing more as a community? And it was then I decided that I was gonna be the voice, and fight for those who fought for us.\u201d\n\nIt was only a year after her son\u2019s death that Lutz made her first foray into advocacy, organizing a motorcycle rally that brought out an unexpectedly large number of people from across the country. She was excited about the hundreds of supporters who turned out, but unsure of what to do next.\n\nThat was until Lutz\u2019s niece played a song for her that she says \u201cgrabbed me by the chest,\u201d and inspired a plan to save the lives of Veterans across the country:\n\nBuddy Up\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to buddy up \u2018cause yup, this is wrong.\n\nSurviving battle, but die when we\u2019re home.\n\nYeah it hurts, that\u2019s why I made this song.\n\nIt\u2019s time to see the signs, like the lights when it\u2019s on.\u201d\n\nThose lyrics are from the song \u201cRed Flags\u201d by Soldier Hard, an artist whose real name is Jeff Barillaro and who also happens to be an Army combat veteran. Barillaro dedicated himself to creating music that gives a voice to veterans, and the issues they experience along with their friends and families. When Lutz heard the lyrics to his song, she says she knew immediately what she had to do.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018you all need to buddy up\u2019\u2026 and he was talking to the veterans out there,\u201d Lutz says. \u201cWhen I heard that, I said that's it. I'm gonna get these guys together, build local communities, facilitate \u2013 I don\u2019t know how, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d\n\nUsing Soldier Hard\u2019s song as inspiration, Lutz has since established two \u201cLutz Buddy Up\u201d social clubs, one in Florida and one in Massachusetts, and this summer she\u2019s touring the country in the hopes of establishing even more. The concept is simple: bringing veterans together (and even first responders) so they can support one another while sharing a meal, playing a game or two, or just chatting.\n\n\u201cWe welcome our veterans just as they are, wherever they are,\u201d Lutz says. \u201cWhatever mindset they're in, we welcome them. All we want to do is connect them with their peers, and it's just been a great success. Dozens and dozens of success stories.\u201d\n\nLutz says membership has skyrocketed from just a handful back in 2014, to well over 500 in 2018 \u2013 including veterans from every U.S. armed conflict since the Korean War.\n\nAsked what she would tell veterans who might be suffering in silence, or friends and family who might be concerned about a veteran they know, Lutz says to remember that connecting with peers is the key.\n\n\u201cThey need to speak to their peers, someone who has walked in their shoes,\u201d Lutz says, before pointing out that this is the exact philosophy soldiers employ on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cThat's what they fight for, to keep the guy next to them alive\u2026 Yeah, they have a mission, but the biggest part is making sure the guy right next to you is alive and well,\u201d Lutz says. \u201cYou're watching each other, and that\u2019s what they have to continue when they get home\u2026\n\n\u201cSo if you don\u2019t have any local buddies you know, find some in your community because they're everywhere, and they're looking for help too,\u201d Lutz says. \u201cReach out to other veterans in your communities because that is your best medicine - your peer who has walked in your shoes.\u201d\n\nIf you are a Veteran in crisis or having thoughts of suicide, or if you are someone who knows a Veteran in crisis, call the Veterans Crisis Line for confidential support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year at 800-273-8255 and press 1.

Over $15,000.00 paid for in full!!!!\" the post read.\n\nFor $7,000, \"flowers, catering, DJ, photography, coordination\" and more were up for grabs from the annonymus couple who called off their own June 23 nuptials.\n\nBRIDE\u2019S IKEA BAG HACK FOR USING BATHROOM ON WEDDING DAY DECLARED \u2018GENIUS\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, engaged high-school sweethearts Nicole Atkinson and Wesley Bodenheimer had previously written off Bella Collina \u2014 which bills itself as \u201cTuscany's version of Cinderella's Castle\u201d \u2014 as being too pricey.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit out of budget, but it's a beautiful venue,\u201d Atkinson told WFMY News 2. \u201cAnyone would want their wedding there \u2014 their dream wedding there.\u201d\n\nThough Atkinson and Bodenheimier had another venue booked for a Nov. 1 wedding, they quickly jumped on the opportunity. The two, who have known each other other since middle school, began dating before Bodenheimier was deployed to serve in Afghanistan with the Air Force, and felt they should give their dream venue another shot.\n\n\u201cReally it was me pushing,\u201d Bodenheimer told Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201c\u2018It would end up being perfect,\u2019\u201d is what I kept saying, and it did end up being perfect.\u201d\n\nThe management of Bella Collina immediately responded to the couple\u2019s message, as they were the first to inquire.\n\n\u201cUsually when people cancel \u2014 it's six months out, eight months out, whatever the case may be. I've never had one this close to the wedding day,\u201d Bella Collina owner Joe Destafino told WFMY. \u201cAt the time I thought it was a crazy idea [to post online]. I mean, we were three days out from the wedding day. What would happen? But, social media is powerful.\u201d\n\nAtkinson and Bodenheimier soon said \u201cI do\u201d to the June 23 wedding date, and quickly laid out plans for the big day with Destafino\u2019s aid.\n\nCOUPLE ESCAPES HOUSE FIRE ON MORNING OF WEDDING: 'IT WAS A NICE ENDING TO A RATHER HORRENDOUS BEGINNING'\n\n\u201cWe did about a year of wedding planning in an hour and 15 minutes with Joe,\u201d Atkinson recalled.\n\nWith many of the elements of the wedding already in place \u2013 from the color scheme to the cake \u2014 Atkinson and Bodenheimier were tasked with gathering guests, obtaining a marriage license, and coordinating their attire. Serendipitously, everything unfolded in their favor.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to go get all the clothes for our groomsmen, they had the exact number of shirts, the exact number of pants, the exact everything. Her dress was almost seven sizes too large for her when she found it, and it was altered in four hours,\u201d Bodenheimer said. \u201cWe had the exact number of bridesmaids dresses that fit everyone perfectly. Everything literally fell in line to the point of it was perfect\u2026 We didn\u2019t have to compromise a single second.\u201d\n\nAccording to WFMY, even an \u201cinitial forecast of rain disappeared,\u201d and the wedding was able to take place outdoors as planned. Forty friends and family gathered at the June 23 celebrations, which happened to be a week before the couple\u2019s seventh anniversary of dating.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nAhead of the festivities, which arrived as somewhat of a surprise, Bodenheimer mused that he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n\u201cI am more than excited that she's going to be my wife. I'll be honest with you, I'm so in love with that woman it's not even funny,\u201d he said of his bride."

Stories of Druids and magical rites arose long after the standing stones true purpose was forgotten.\n\nLittle can be inferred about the role such monuments played in Neolithic cultures. We know many were aligned to the Sun and stars. There are traces of ceremonial pathways. Now, human sacrifice has entered the picture.\n\nBut new excavations near the German town of P\u00f6mmelte are raising some disturbing possibilities.\n\nIt\u2019s the site of an ancient stone-age sanctuary, contemporary to Stonehenge itself.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex of concentric-ring mounds, ditches and deeply sunken wooden posts.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of several sites in Central Europe, Portugal and Spain that indicates circular henge monuments are not uniquely British.\n\nGhastly ceremonies\n\nArchaeologists say the German site appears to have been a gathering place for community events and rituals.\n\nA series of pits have been uncovered containing evidence these activities. This includes fragments of ceramic pots and cups, stone axes and animal bones.\n\nThey reveal the P\u00f6mmelte henge was active for some 300 years, starting from 2300BCE.\n\nBut among the P\u00f6mmelte scraps were some disturbing finds.\n\nThe dismembered bodies of 10 women and children.\n\nLead researcher Andr\u00e9 Spatzier says it appears the victims had been pushed into the pit. At least one of the teenagers had their hands bound together.\n\nARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE 'CRUSHED' POMPEII MAN'S SKULL, AND IT WILL SURPRISE YOU\n\nWhile the archaeologists say they cannot yet be certain of the purpose of their deaths, the idea of ritual sacrifice was a strong possibility. No adult males were found in the pits, and the items they were buried with showed signs of having been ritualistically smashed.\n\nA handful of male bodies were unearthed away from the pits, on the eastern side of the henge. These men, aged 17 to 30, had been interred with great care, in their own graves.\n\nLike Stonehenge, the site itself was not permanently inhabited. There bodies were undamaged.\n\n\u201cThe henge monuments of the British Isles are generally considered to represent a uniquely British phenomenon, unrelated to Continental Europe; this position should now be reconsidered,\u201d the researchers write in the journal Antiquity. \u201cThe uniqueness of Stonehenge lies, strictly speaking, with its monumental megalithic architecture.\u201d\n\nGerman henge\n\nThe P\u00f6mmelte henge is a 115m-wide series of concentric mounds. Many have evidence of \u201cwood-henge\u201d style post holes sunk within them.\n\nIt was discovered from the air in 1991, but excavations only began recently.\n\nExcavations show it was built during the transition between the Neolithic Stone Age to the early Bronze Age. This is the same era as Stonehenge.\n\nStonehenge is positioned in such a way as to mark the arrival of the summer solstice.\n\nHUMAN SACRIFICES SURROUND ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIAN TOMB\n\nP\u00f6mmelte henge, however, has its four entrances aligned with dates half way between the equinoxes and solstices. Spatzier says these were key agricultural planting and harvesting dates.\n\nArchaeologists believe P\u00f6mmelte henge ended its days about 2050BC in what was likely to have been a ceremonial decommissioning. The wooden post holes had been filled with artefacts. One of the concentric pits was filled with ash \u2014 likely from the burnt posts.\n\n\u201cIt looks like at the end of the main occupation, around 2050 B.C., they extracted the posts, put offerings into the post holes and probably burned all the wood and back-shoved it into the ditch,\u201d Professor Spatzier told Live Science. \u201cSo, they closed all the features. It was still visible above ground, but only as a shovel depression.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by news.com.au."

The Kona gets nearly everything right, assuming you like bizarre headlight arrangements.\n\nThe Kona starts at $20,480 and is one of the smallest SUVs, but can accommodate four adults more than just fine in its surprisingly spacious and high quality cabin. The cargo area isn\u2019t the biggest, but the rear seats fold down to expand it with a perfectly flat surface. The standard engine is a 147 hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and all-wheel-drive costs $1,300.\n\nIt\u2019s equipped with a standard backup camera and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration in this configuration, but move up the trim levels and things start to get very interesting.\n\nThere you\u2019ll find heated leather seats, a blind spot monitor, a wireless charging pad, head-up display, automatic emergency brakes and 175 hp 1.6-liter turbocharged engine that comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission \u2013 just like a Porsche 911 has. (Well, technically.)\n\nHyundai calls the top of the line model the Kona Ultimate, and a fully-loaded one rings up at $29,680. That includes a booming Infinity audio system and one of the best lane keeping assist systems I\u2019ve ever experience. On a road with well-marked lines the Kona locks itself dead in the center of it and doesn\u2019t play ping pong between them like a lot of other cars do. As long as things don\u2019t get too twisty, you hardly have to steer.\n\nYou do have to keep your hand on the wheel to prove you're paying attention, but the feature works so well it makes you wonder how much longer that will be needed. Sadly the Kona doesn\u2019t offer adaptive cruise control to go with it, but I guess Hyundai has to give you a reason to look at its other models.\n\nYou might not have to otherwise. Unless you really need a lot more space, the Kona fits many bills. The engine is potent, smooth and efficient. The EPA highway rating on the all-wheel-drive Ultimate I tested is just 29 mpg, but I saw 32-33 mpg in mixed driving.\n\nI took it everywhere from the city to the freeway and twisty mountain roads still pockmarked from winter, and the Kona was an ace on all of them. Hyundai\u2019s engineers nailed the ride quality, which isn\u2019t too stiff or sloppy and doesn't get upset by the kind of washboard surfaces that can trip up even some luxury cars. At this price point, in a vehicle like this, you couldn\u2019t expect anything better.\n\nIt can be legitimately fun to drive, too, especially when you put it in Sport mode. It plays longer in the lower gears in this setting, adds weight to the already excellent steering feel and livens up the throttle. Combined with pleasantly sharp handling, it\u2019s much more entertaining than most of its ilk.\n\nHyundai may have been sitting this one out for a long time, but now it\u2019s sitting near the front of the class.\n\n----------\n\n2018 Hyundai Kona\n\nBase price: $20,480\n\nAs tested: $29,680\n\nType: 5-passenger, 4-door all-wheel-drive SUV\n\nEngine: 1.6-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder\n\nPower: 175 hp, 195 lb-ft\n\nTransmission: 7-speed automatic\n\nMPG: 26 city/29 hwy"

The 5-4 ruling marks the first major high court decision on a Trump administration policy. It upholds the selective travel restrictions, which critics called a discriminatory \"Muslim ban\" but the administration argued was needed for security reasons.\n\nFox News @ Night anchor Shannon Bream sits down with Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to break down the ruling.\n\nOn the dissent comparing the travel ban to Japanese internment camps: There were two different dissents and we had an unusual thing happen today in the court. When they decide an opinion and they announce it usually there's a bit of the majority opinion that's read from the bench, sort of a summary of what it is, the justice who actually wrote it reads. Occasionally, in a really passionate or heated case someone will read their dissent or a bit of it. Today two dissenting justices. That is exceptionally rare. (00:30)\n\nOn the question of whether the President's previous statements can be used to prove intent with the travel ban: Yeah, it's interesting because they talked about finding whether or not there was a legitimate justification or explanation for what they have done here and they said looking at the text of it the face of it alone they can see that there are legitimate reasons around these issues of national security and about working with these countries that don't want to provide us the proper information. So they turn away from examining the comments. They're certainly outlined all throughout the opinion and the dissent, but they said basically there is enough of a legitimate purpose here that we go with that explanation. (2:27)\n\nOn the pro-life centers ruling: When it comes to the First Amendment this court has been, in recent years and long-term, they have been exceptionally defensive of the First Amendment. I was a little surprised it was 5-4. (6:32)\n\nListen below:"

Third time is the charm \u2014 the 100-year old Harley-Davidson 1000 18-J motorcycle starts.\n\n\u201cThis is a time machine,\u201d de Goulaine told Fox News. No, not in the literal sense, but the WWI-era motorcycle paints an accurate picture of life in the early 20th century.\n\nIt was one of an estimated 20,000 olive green Harley-Davidson motorcycles used by American soldiers in the Great War.\n\nFrench motorcycle enthusiasts de Goulaine and Pierre Lauvergeat spent the past year renovating it. Still, the bike largely holds true to its origins with the same engine, frame and seat it left the factory with.\n\n\u201cIt was a non-runner, it was in terrible condition,\u201d de Goulaine said, while showing pictures of bike parts in boxes. \u201cNow the bike is on the road, and we\u2019ll have a little road test for about 5,000 miles.\u201d\n\n5,000 miles \u2014 not a typo.\n\nThe Model J and its sidecar rolled onto American soil for the first time in a century, kick-starting a nationwide repatriation tour this week.\n\nThe pair of Frenchmen are riding from Alabama to Florida, up to Wisconsin, and west to California in the refurbished antique.\n\nThe mastermind mechanic, Lauvergeat, said the bike could fail at anytime. Yet, the unpredictable motorcycle and ambitious mileage ahead of it have not depleted the pair\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\nThe mission, dubbed Operation Twin Links, is a nod to Americans who laid down their lives in WWI to assist their oldest ally \u2014 the French.\n\nThe project, being executed on the 100th anniversary of the war\u2019s end, honors the numerous links between America and France. Most obviously, it recognizes America\u2019s assistance in both World Wars.\n\nA look at Lauvergeat\u2019s and de Goulaine\u2019s family history explains their relentless enthusiasm in the ambitious undertaking.\n\nAmerican soldiers liberated Lauvergeat\u2019s grandfather and father from the trenches in 1917 and German camps in 1944, respectively.\n\nDe Goulaine is a descendant of a French explorer who colonized what is recognized today as Jacksonville, Fla. Jacksonville and Nantes, France (de Goulaine\u2019s hometown) are now honorary twin cities.\n\n\u201cWe love America,\u201d de Goulaine said. \u201cI think this is a way to say \u2018we love you\u2019 very simply.\u201d\n\nDe Goulaine and Lauvergeat are symbolically reversing the bike\u2019s path to France. They returned the bike through the port in Mobile, Ala. \u2014 the home state of General William L. Sibert, who commanded the 1st Infantry Division in France during WWI, nicknamed \u201cThe Big Red One.\u201d Now, they\u2019re riding from East to West.\n\nThe U.S. WWI Centennial Commission sponsors hundreds of commemoration projects worldwide, but director of public affairs Chris Isleib said Operation Twin Links stands out from the rest.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time a historic event mattered so much to somebody that they wanted to come over and personally thank the people who were involved and the descendants of the people who were involved?\u201d Isleib asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nDuring the three-month tour, only de Goulaine and Lauvergeat will lay hands on the bike when issues arise, but the two-man mission has an army of support.\n\nFrench journalists Olivier Touron and Thierry Butzbach are shadowing the entire cross-country trek. Both France and America\u2019s WWI Centennial Commissions are sponsoring the trip. A wide range of private companies have offered help, from restaurants to spare parts companies and of course, Harley-Davidson.\n\nJust days into the journey, the project has already shed light on WWI via social media around the world.\n\n\u201cA lot of education of WWI that used to happen does not anymore, so people don\u2019t always understand or appreciate what happened 100 years ago,\u201d Isleib said. \u201c[It\u2019s] projects like this [that] really help us to remember who the people were who served and why they served.\u201d\n\nLauvergeat holds up his hands and then points to his smile and de Goulaine \u2014 expressing the three ways he will communicate his thanks to Americans, despite not speaking a lick of English.\n\nLauvergeat exclaims (de Goulaine translates): \u201cI love American people. Without them, I wouldn\u2019t be here today!\u201d"

Oh, no. In fact, thanks to a strong economy and stock market, the state of California has raked in 61.5 BILLION dollars through April for the current fiscal year.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? Why does the state with the highest personal income tax rate also have the highest poverty rate? The answer is pretty simple: It\u2019s been run into the ground by the Democrats \u2013 who have never met a tax they didn\u2019t like.\n\nAt some point we have to ask, with all these billions in tax revenue, why did the Democrats vote yet again, to add another 12 cents a gallon in gasoline taxes in the state? That makes it not one, but two excise taxes on gasoline - a primary AND secondary excise tax.\n\nTomi Lahren: Trump Supporters Should Not Justify Roseanne's 'Indefensible' Tweet\n\nTomi Lahren: Take a Moment to Remember What Memorial Day Is Really About\n\nIt\u2019s not just the taxes. The state is unaffordable for most middle-class Americans. Take housing, for instance. The median home value is $409,000 \u2013 more than double the national average, according to the 2016 census.\n\nAnd rent prices? Those are sky-high, too, and run about 40 percent above the national average.\n\nYeah, Hollywood entertainers and Silicon Valley tech gurus can afford to live in this state. But the average American cannot. That\u2019s why more than a million people moved out of California from 2006 to 2016.\n\nInstead of recognizing this squeeze, your favorite California bureaucrats decided, \u201chey let\u2019s make it even more unaffordable!\u201d So they slapped on a solar panel mandate for all new residential buildings, apartments and condos that are three stories or less.\n\nAmid a housing crisis, the mandate will tack on an average of more than $10,500 to a new home\u2019s cost. That\u2019s a big headache for already struggling middle class families.\n\nBut hey, if housing isn\u2019t for you, you could always take up residence in one of the many Third World-style encampments scattered along our freeways and interstates! According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the homeless population in California rose by 14 percent from 2016 to 2017, to 134,000. The increase was even worse in Los Angeles \u2013 where it rose 26 percent in one year.\n\nIn sharp contrast, the national homeless population increased by only one percent in 2017.\n\nAnd California is proof that even a strong national economy can\u2019t make up for poor leadership. While Governor Jerry Brown and friends are out courting the unions and fattening pension programs, average Californians are struggling.\n\nBut California Democrats have made clear they don\u2019t care much about the middle class. They are far more concerned with shielding illegal immigrants from deportation, and showering them with the benefits of the system. As a result, our estimated three million illegal residents cost us billions.\n\nAnd now California Democrats are raising the stakes: The state might become the first to offer health care coverage to illegal immigrants.\n\nIf all this doesn\u2019t sit right with you, get out and vote in tomorrow\u2019s primary. This is a great state. It\u2019s time to take it back.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts. From LA, God Bless and take care.\n\nTomi Lahren on New NFL Anthem Policy: Americans Used Their Remotes and Made a Difference\n\nTomi Lahren: 'Knee-Jerk Reactions' on Gun Control 'Never the Solution'"

Please share.\u201d\n\nThe controversial images, which were posted by a Kentucky woman identified as Tess Thompson Talley a year ago, show her standing proudly beside a dead giraffe bull along with the caption: \u201cPrayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today! Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite a while. I knew it was the one. He was over 18 years old, 4000 lbs. and was blessed to be able to get 2000 lbs. of meat from him.\u201d\n\nTrophy hunting is a legal practice in a number of African countries, including South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cThe giraffe I hunted was the South African sub-species of giraffe. The numbers of this sub-species is actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting. The breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old. Giraffes get darker with age,\u201d said Talley, in an email to Fox News.\n\nShe points out that the giraffe she killed was 18, too old to breed, and had killed three younger bulls who were able to breed, causing the herd\u2019s population to decrease. Now, with the older giraffe dead, the younger bulls are able to continue to breed and can increase the population.\n\n\u201cThis is called conservation through game management,\u201d says Talley, who insists hers was not a \u201ccanned\u201d hunt.\n\nProminent activist and Hollywood actor Ricky Gervais, on the same day Talley\u2019s images went viral, tweeted that \u201cGiraffes are now on the 'red list' of endangerment due to a 40% decline over the last 25 years. They could become extinct. Gone forever. And still, we allow spoilt c--ts to pay money to shoot them with a bow and arrow for fun.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is some debate of the \u201crarity\u201d of the giraffe on Talley\u2019s hit list.\n\n\u201cThe giraffe in the photo is of the South African species Giraffa giraffe, which are not rare \u2013 they are increasing in the wild,\u201d Julian Fennessy, Ph.D., co-founder of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation told Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cLegal hunting of giraffe is not a reason for their decline, despite the moral and ethical side of it which is a different story.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the images have spurred deep emotions among those opposed to the controversial practice.\n\n\u201cShame on you to think your life is more than any other living creature and gives you the right to end its life! Who are you to place yourself above any other living creature,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cI hope nature takes revenge on you!\u201d\n\nOthers have vowed that \u201ckilling animals for fun is a sign of serious mental illness,\u201d while others have referred to Talley as a \u201cdisgusting excuse for a human being\u201d and a \u201cspoiled wealthy brat with no conscience.\u201d She was also referred to as a \u201cdisgusting, vile, amoral, heartless, selfish murderer\u201d by actress Debra Messing.\n\nHowever, the self-described passionate hunter is hardly the first American to come under intense Internet fire in recent times for overseas trophy kills.\n\nNikki Tate, a 27-year-old lawyer and \u201cethical hunter\u201d from Texas sparked outcry \u2013 and death threats \u2013 late last year after she posted pictures with her kills. But she also attested to receiving scores of messages of support too, being referred to as a \u201crole model and inspiration\u201d in the conservation arena.\n\nAnd in 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer was internationally scorned after killing the famous \u201cCecile the Lion\u201d near a national park in Zimbabwe.\n\n\"I get that hunting is not for everyone; that\u2019s what makes this world great is the differences. But to make threats to anyone because they don\u2019t believe the way you do is completely unacceptable. If it was any other belief that was different, threats and insults would be deemed hideous. However, for some reason it is OK to act this way because it\u2019s hunting,\" Talley wrote in her email.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the issue of trophy hunting abroad remains a controversial one legislatively as conservation and welfare groups are banding together to encourage the Trump administration to reject import permits for South African lions.\n\nUnder a new process instituted in March this year, trophy hunters are able to provide the U.S government with information confidentially rather than giving public notice in their quest to obtain an import permit, raising questions over the legalities how the kill was carried out, and whether or not mostly illicit practices such as \u201cbaiting\u201d were used, violating the ethics of \u201cfair chase.\u201d\n\nBig-game hunters appointed by the Trump team to assist in the re-writing of federal rules pertaining to the importing of heads from African elephants and lions last week defended the trophy hunting practice, contending that threatened and endangered species would go extinct without the anti-poaching programs financed in large part by the hefty fees wealthy Americans pay to carry out the souvenir slaughters.\n\nWhere the president himself now stands on the matter, however, remains unclear.\n\n\u201cBig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal,\u201d he tweeted in November."

Is there any way I can stop it for good?\n\nA: In many ways, I\u2019m glad that major digital crimes have grabbed so many headlines the past few years \u2013 not because I want people to face-off with hackers or lose their banking information, but because so many people are finally taking cyber security seriously. Even your browser and search engine may seem to be conspiring against you, announcing your IP address to anyone with access. It\u2019s frustrating and frightening, and luckily, you don\u2019t have to endure that exposure anymore. Click here to get the ways that pros increase their privacy online.\n\nBe Invisible\n\nQ: Whenever I Google something, I see ads for that search wherever I go online. Is it possible to use the internet without seeing these ads?\n\nA: Your search history is very helpful, but it\u2019s also revealing to anyone who finds it. Cookies are perhaps the most sinister offenders \u2013 those little files that your computer automatically downloads when you visit a website.

What topics do you cover in your other podcasts and how can get them?\n\nA: First of all, thank you for the kind words. It's funny because I think about my early career in radio, when everything was analog, and how difficult it was to archive my show. These days, it's considered a standard operating procedure to record shows digitally and then make them available online. This way, anyone to listen to any episode at any time. If you love tech, you\u2019ve come to the right place! Click here for the Komando podcast directory and shows.\n\nConvert Film to Digital\n\nQ: I have a ton of old slides and photos from my parents\u2019 estate. How can I get them into my computer? I\u2019d like to share them with my family.\n\nA: Like so many people, the \u201ccarousel\u201c was a Hallmark of my childhood. I still find the slide projector magical, the way many people are drawn to vinyl records. But traditional is rapidly disappearing, and those old slides and 35mm rolls will only degrade into extinction if we fail to digitize them for posterity. Some collections are large enough that families will invest in their own specialized scanner, but most of us would prefer to handle this task off to a professional. Some services will even touch up damaged photos, making them look good as new.

I saw them, but I have my doubts.\n\nA: There is an app for everything, but if a digital mosquito repellent sounds like science fiction, I don't blame you for thinking that. Mosquitoes ruin everything, and most of us will continue to use a trusty can of DEET or a citronella candle to keep the bloodthirsty insects at bay. But if you have a smartphone, and you spend a lot of time in the great outdoors, you should give one of these apps a shot. Not surprisingly, there are also unique gadgets that will help you with your six-legged problem. My recommendation is to combine the two: use a little spray, tinker with the app, and you might just be looking at a welt free summer.

[It] is someone giving their soul to Jesus and surrendering their life to Jesus. That\u2019s what I love about Bethel \u2014 they create space for God to move in miracles.\u201d\n\nFox News recently spoke with Conant and two other worship leaders \u2013 Josh Baldwin and Bethany Wohrle \u2013 ahead of their final night of their tour at the Beacon Theatre in New York City and on the heels of their second annual \u201cHeaven Come Conference\u201d in Dallas, that had close to 6,000 people in attendance and many described as \u201clife-changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird Great Awakening\u201d\n\nThe group had just left Boston, where they said 800 people flooded to the front to give their lives to Jesus at the end of the meeting.\n\n\u201cPeople were so hungry,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cIt does feel like people are re-upping their commitment to the Lord. It\u2019s been powerful every night\u2026we would stop [in worship] and they would lead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something the worship leaders are used to experiencing when they travel to other nations, but they said they're starting to see that kind of hunger for God\u2019s presence in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt felt like we were tapping into an old well,\u201d Conant passionately said. \u201cWe need another Great Awakening, and it came out of this region for the Second Great Awakening.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, who sang his new single \u201cStand in Your Love,\u201d which comes out next month, backed her up.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like we\u2019re on edge, like something\u2019s about to break and there\u2019s about to be another big awakening,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI feel like the younger generation \u2013 millennials \u2013 sometimes can get a bad rap, but the thing I love about it is that they are all-in on whatever they\u2019re going for\u2026and the ones that are going after the Lord they\u2019re so passionate about it that I feel like that\u2019s what changes our nation \u2013 their passion and their hunger.\u201d\n\nConant said: \u201cIt\u2019s like Jesus needs to be re-introduced to a whole generation, like He\u2019s not mad at you. He\u2019s not up there waiting to strike you with a lightning bolt. He is a God of love. For God so loved the world that He sent His son, and now Jesus wants to send us with that same love to reach a generation\u2026that\u2019s where I go we\u2019re all missionaries\u2026Jesus said as the Father sent me so I am sending you\u2026OK, well, that\u2019s pretty gangster if that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn encounter with Bethel\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s been one of Baldwin\u2019s favorite things about the tour. He sees it as a \u201creintroduction to the gospel and Jesus,\u201d where people can expect to experience \u201cthe presence of the Lord.\u201d\n\nWohrle added that people can expect \u201ctheir lives to be changed\u201d after an encounter with Bethel.\n\nBethel is known for having extended time for worship, where the singers and band members will break into spontaneous worship either at the beginning, end or middle of the song. For those unfamiliar with spontaneous worship, it may seem like it\u2019s choreographed or planned, but that\u2019s just a testament to how easy it is for Bethel.\n\nAlthough he grew up in the church, Baldwin said the risk of spontaneous worship never really goes away, but he added he \u201cfeels more comfortable\u201d in it now \u201cknowing that the Lord\u2019s going to meet you there.\u201d\n\nWohrle added that Bethel\u2019s culture makes it a place where that\u2019s possible.\n\nIt\u2019s like Jesus needs to be re-introduced to a whole generation, like He\u2019s not mad at you. He\u2019s not up there waiting to strike you with a lightning bolt. He is a God of love. - Lindy Conant\n\n\u201cI think coming from Bethel, and having the leadership that we have, gives us the authority to step into things that we would never do on our own, and so I feel like the way Brian and Jenn, and Bill Johnson, all of the worship leaders, and even going through ministry school, too, they give you the freedom to take a risk and to step out in faith,\u201d Wohrle said. \u201cIf you fail, you fail, and you just start back over again and try again.\u201d\n\nOne of the things Bethel\u2019s founder, Bill Johnson, says is, \u201cI\u2019d rather have wildfire than no fire\u201d in response to people who criticize Bethel or have been burned by the charismatic or supernatural movement.\n\nConant, who recently started working with Bethel, said she was drawn to the \u201cunapologetic presence of God\u201d and \u201cthe amount of people that get healed\u201d in God\u2019s presence.\n\nFor her, spontaneous worship can only happen if you don\u2019t fear man more than you fear God. It\u2019s something Conant said is all throughout the Bible, but is often overlooked: \u201cThe whole purpose is to illuminate Jesus.\u201d\n\nAnd all three leaders agreed that spontaneous worship is more of a team sport, including each one of the musicians, not to mention the reaction from the crowd, more so than just one person. They\u2019ve seen spontaneous moments speak to people in ways that scripted sermons never could.\n\n\u201cI think God\u2019s going to use healing in America to lead so many people to Jesus,\u201d Conant added. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing the demonstration of God that causes salvation, too, which is the greatest miracle \u2013 is someone giving their soul to Jesus and surrendering their life to Jesus \u2013 that\u2019s what I love about Bethel is they create space for God to move in miracles\u2026\u201d\n\nNext year, Bethel\u2019s third \u201cHeaven Come Conference\u201d is happening at two locations, Los Angeles in May and Dallas in August, with Pastors Jentezen Franlkin and Steven Furtick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see what that\u2019s going to do in the United States,\u201d Wohrle said.\n\n\u201cWe are ripe for a Great Awakening,\u201d Conant said. \u201cThere are so many stadium events now. It was not this way 10 years ago \u2026 there really is something happening, and I think Jesus is leading it \u2026 filling stadiums, I think it moves the heart of God and it causes people to go, \u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d"

Even older-model phones can cost hundreds of dollars, never mind the $1,149 you'd have to pay for an iPhone X with 256GB, or the Samsung Galaxy S9, which costs upwards of $950.\n\nIn fact, there are phones that rival the iPhone and Samsung you may have never heard of before now. Click here for the 10 best smartphones in the world.\n\nNo matter the carrier, the freefall days of free and discounted phones are over, at least among mainstream providers. The pressure to own a smartphone is high, so how do you keep those expenses as low as possible? Here are five smart ways to keep that bill manageable.\n\n1. Check out the secret carriers\n\n\u201cSecret carrier\u201d sounds sketchy, but it\u2019s shorthand for a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). These are wireless communication service providers that do not own the wireless network infrastructure they use. Instead, they operate \u201cvirtually\u201d on another carrier\u2019s network.\n\nMVNO will lease cell coverage and data bandwidth from one of the big carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon - and resell it to their customers. The reception is often just as clear and strong, because they\u2019re using the same technology.\n\nMany MVNO companies offer cheaper plans than what you will find with the big providers. Sign-up is usually simple, and with a low-commitment, you\u2019re rarely subjected to a credit check, and there are many \u201ca la carte\u201d options and add-ons. Here are a few of the most popular options:\n\nVirgin Mobile\n\nVirgin Mobile customers are using Sprint's nationwide 4G LTE network with one plan to choose from. It has no annual contract and no hidden fees.\n\nThe \"Innercircle\" plan by Virgin Mobile costs $50 per month for one line and comes with unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data. You can add a mobile hotspot for $10 per month, phone insurance for $7 per month, and international calling for $5 per month.\n\nStraightTalk Wireless\n\nStraightTalk Wireless uses all of the big four providers' networks.\n\nWith one line, it's $35 per month, and you get unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data. If you want to bump your data up to 10GB, that plan costs $45 per month. Its unlimited data plan will run you $55 per month.\n\nBoost Mobile\n\nBoost Mobile uses Sprint's network and has 99 percent nationwide coverage with voice roaming.\n\nIf you have one line, it costs $35 per month for unlimited talk and text and comes with 3GB of data. For $50 per month, your data is unlimited and comes with 8 Gigs of hotspot. And if you want to stream HD video up to 1080p, it costs $60 per month, which comes with unlimited talk, text, and data plus 20 Gigs of a hotspot.\n\n2. Use Wi-Fi whenever you can\n\nMobile providers sometimes offer unlimited data plans. However, many people choose to sign up for less expensive plans that have capped data amounts each month. This reduces the amount of data you can use, but if you spend most of your time in a Wi-Fi-connected environment \u2013 home or office \u2013 you don\u2019t need all that data anyway.\n\nRather than looking for free Wi-Fi, put an app on your phone. Click here for the one I use that has a map of more than a 100 million free Wi-Fi hotspots worldwide.\n\n3. Make sure you are not paying for insurance and any extras\n\nOne way to cut back on your cell phone bill is not to add insurance on your gadget. Think about how much you're paying for it over the course of a year.\n\nA $15-per-month insurance plan would cost $180 for the year. If you have a family of four and insurance on each device, that would add up to $720 for the year.\n\nDon't feel like you're missing out on a quality phone just because you didn't go with the thousand-dollar high-end device. There are some lower-priced gadgets out there that have all the essential features you'll need; you have to look for them. Click here for some extra cheap phones even iPhone users would crave.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s wise to scan your cell phone bill to see everything that you're paying for. You might be surprised by what you find. Anything that you don't need (usual extras are enhanced voicemail or roadside assistance) should be canceled.\n\n4. Set up data overage alerts\n\nIf you don't have an unlimited data plan and go over the allowed amount, you're going to have to pay overage fees. These charges add up quickly.\n\nOne way to avoid overages, on top of our Wi-Fi suggestion I spoke of earlier, is to set up an overage alert with your provider. All the primary providers have an overage alert feature that is simple to set up. You need to log into your account and search for overage alerts to find out how to set it up with your particular carrier.\n\nOnce you've set up the alert, you will receive automatic text and email alerts from your provider when you hit 75 or 90 percent of your monthly allowances for voice, messaging or data.\n\n5. Go to a prepaid plan and check for discounts\n\nPrepaid and no-contract providers often get great reception and many people like their flexible service. You can avoid credit checks and hefty fees, and you can switch off the service whenever you want. Companies like metroPCS and Cricket Wireless have reasonably priced monthly plans that won't break the bank.\n\nFor example, metroPCS offers a no-annual-contract plan for $30 per month that gives you unlimited talk and text and 2GB of data at up to 4G LTE speeds. If you need more data, you can pay $40 per month for unlimited talk and text and 5GB of data.\n\nIts unlimited data plan costs $50 per month, and for unlimited data plus 10GB of a hotspot, it will run you $60 per month. All of these plan prices include taxes and regulatory fees, so you won't pay more than what the plan calls for up front.\n\nCricket Wireless plans are similarly priced. It costs $30 per month for unlimited talk and text with 2GB of high-speed data. For 5GB of data, the monthly plan costs $40, and for unlimited talk, text, and data it costs $55 per month ($50 per month if you sign up for auto pay).\n\nIf you decide to go with a no-contract provider, make sure to ask about discounts. Most of them offer multi-line discounts, so you would pay even less if you add your entire family to your plan.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

In fact, this single statement led to weeks of discussion on race and the right degree of government involvement in race-related issues.\n\nShe said the reaction was \"shocking\" because she hadn't seen that type of opposition to free speech before in her school.\n\nShe also said that many teachers don't debate politics in their classes because it's a \"sensitive\" topic.\n\nChen wrote in her op-ed that as so many students today are opinionated, they've forgotten the value of a diversity of opinion.\n\n\"In a school that practices diversity in almost anything, we were really missing a huge chunk of diversity,\" Chen said.\n\nFree speech is important, even \u2014 or, perhaps, especially \u2014 in high school, because it makes people uncomfortable. Discomfort sparks discussion and promotes an acceptance of the existence of different opinions.\n\nShe said that a diversity of opinion should be respected by everyone, and that those who can't are not open-minded or free-thinking.\n\nWatch the segment above.\n\n'F*** the Law!': CUNY Law School Students Disrupt Professor's Lecture on Free Speech\n\n'Their Efforts Are Stalinist': Ingraham Says 'We Will Never Give In' to Censorship of Conservatives\n\n'We're Taking a Stand': Illinois County Declares Itself a Sanctuary for Gun Owners"

Rumors of another vacancy have reverberated across Washington in recent months, and it comes a year after Kennedy's former law clerk Justice Neil Gorsuch, took over the seat occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

After two delays, the GOP compromise bill has failed in the house amid ongoing speculation on Capitol Hill that the measure would not pass. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act, negotiated by both moderates and conservatives amid pressure for Congress to finally provide a legislative fix to the country's immigration problems, failed by a large margin of 121 \"yes\" votes to 301 \"no\" votes on Wednesday. The measure aimed to create a new merit-based visa program, appropriate $25 billion for border security, and sought to end family separation at the border by allowing children to remain in DHS custody for longer than 20 days and mandating that their parents be held in DHS custody rather than DOJ custody if they are being prosecuted for border crossing.

The baby reportedly never lost consciousness, but was crying hysterically. So out of an abundance of caution, the family took him to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, the outlet reported.\n\nDoctors quickly determined that eight-month-old Park Jeong-whan was fine. The family told the news site that the baby had some formula, took a little snooze and they got on with their vacation.\n\nTwo years later, the family said they were handed the bill: $18,836.\n\n\u201cIf my baby got special treatment, OK,\u201d Jang Yeo-im, the baby\u2019s mother, told Vox. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t.

These charges can range from $1,000 to $50,000, according to the report. One expert likened the charge to \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d\n\nHospitals defend the charge by essentially saying it costs money to keep a good response team on hand.\n\n\u201cWe are the trauma center for a very large, very densely populated area. We deal with so many traumas in this city \u2014 car accidents, mass shootings, multiple vehicle collisions,\u201d a hospital spokesman told Vox. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to prepare for that.\u201d"

I rescued her from the Dallas Humane Society two years ago. She\u2019s as spunky as I am and doesn\u2019t take \"no\" for an answer. Rescue animals have a special place in my heart.\n\nMy family has always chosen adoption over the pet store and I hope you do too!\n\nMy parents have been married for 36 years this June. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am in this world without their constant love and support. They taught me that anything worth doing is worth doing right.\n\nI credit my public speaking abilities to my parents. They never talked baby talk to me. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been able to speak and write well.\n\nRunning is my exercise of choice. I run seven miles each and every morning. It is on my runs where I am able to clear my head and plan for the day. I often come up with my Final Thoughts on these morning runs and I even stop to type notes and one-liners into my phone en route! I also come up with some of my best tweets when I run.\n\nI am blessed to live near the beach in sunny Southern California. There\u2019s something about that ocean and salty air that makes the seven miles suck less. My running addiction has left me with some pretty gnarly scars on my knees but hey, when you run nearly 50 miles a week a few tumbles are bound to happen.\n\nI\u2019ve recently started doing Cryotherapy for my knees and ankles. Fingers crossed it\u2019ll do the trick and keep me on my toes!\n\nMy parents both come from ranching families. Although we didn\u2019t have a ranch when I was growing up, we did have horses.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like growing up with wide open spaces, fresh air, and horses grazing the pasture. Living out in the country is also a great place to practice my Second Amendment freedoms.\n\nI have two tattoos. I got my first tattoo on my 21st birthday. I designed it myself. It is a wheat leaf crossed with the state flower of South Dakota, the pasque flower.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of where I came from.\n\nMy second tattoo is a roman numeral 11 with a semicolon. Eleven is my lucky number. It shows up constantly and randomly in my everyday life.\n\nThe semicolon is a reminder to keep going when I could easily stop.

This includes a line-lock, which brakes just the front wheels to make it easier to warm up the tires with a burnout, and a launch control system programmed to reduce wheel hop. Meanwhile, the Demon\u2019s transmission brake, Drag Mode calibration and optional race gas compatible engine control unit were retired with it to help keep the 3,300 examples of it that were built a little extra special.\n\nDodge is offering the Hellcat Redeye in normal and widebody versions, both with a claimed top speed of 203 mph. The fatter tires on the widebody help deliver a 10.8-second quarter-mile time, while the standard version trails it at a still-blistering 11.1 seconds.\n\nUnlike the Demon, the Hellcat won\u2019t be offered from the factory with just one seat, but a rear seat and belt delete package is available to turn it into a two-passenger vehicle.\n\nPricing for the Hellcat Redeye will be announced closer to its on sale date this fall, but should land somewhere between the 2018 Hellcat\u2019s $65,995 and Demon\u2019s $84,995."

The fire has moved so fast firefighters have been unable to tally the destruction to homes and buildings.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the fire was zero percent contained, the paper reported.\n\nThe Spring Creek fire was one of a dozen wildfires firefighters are battling across the state."

In February 2017, a piece of the glacier approximately 1 mile wide separated. And in September 2017, a chunk of ice nearly four times the size of Manhattan separated from the Pine Island Glacier, according to LiveScience.\n\nTHE COLDEST PLACE ON EARTH IS EVEN COLDER THAN SCIENTISTS THOUGHT\n\nThe amount of ice going into the ocean is staggering, measured in gigatons, Loose said. A gigaton is equal to 1 billion metric tons.\n\nIt's well understood that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies on top of a large or major volcanic rift system, but there has been no current magmatic activity, Loose noted. The last recorded activity was 2,200 years ago, but the volcanic heat discovered is new. Loose said it's impossible to measure the normal indicators of the volcanism, including heat and smoke, because the rift is so far below the ice.\n\nDespite the discovery of the volcanic heat, the researchers noted that climate change is still the driving force for melting the ice, something other studies have repeatedly backed up, Loose said.\n\n\u201cClimate change is causing the bulk of glacial melt that we observe, and this newly discovered source of heat is having an as-yet undetermined effect, because we do not know how this heat is distributed beneath the ice sheet,\" Loose said.\n\n\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia"

			"text": "As a mother of two young children, my heart cries out when I see what is taking place at our southern border, specifically children who are being separated from their parents through no fault of their own.\n\nAs a mother, I cannot imagine the pain their mothers\u2019 hearts must be suffering at this present moment. I doubt most Americans know the words to adequately express such anguish.\n\nAs a mother, I\u2019ve tried desperately to understand what is taking place. I have often tried to envision a scenario so horrible that I would feel like I have no choice but to take my chances to get onto American soil. I\u2019ve tried to imagine a situation so staggering that would cause me to release my little ones into the care of complete strangers, to be smuggled into the U.S., knowing the odds of me seeing them again is remote?\n\nHonestly, I have yet to imagine such a world. Most Americans can\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe we have the vocabulary to express the depth of pain, despair, hopelessness, lack and confusion that these people\u2019s lives must be like in their home country.\n\nAnd as I try to understand all of this, I am left with two primary thoughts:\n\nFirst is the kind of extreme misery these people must be fleeing. I grew up very impoverished. When my grandmother would ask me to help her in the garden, I thought she just wanted to spend quality time with me. I never knew it was for our survival. But it was.\n\nAs calls are being made that we take a hard stance against North Korea and their horrific human rights violations, some of that spotlight should also shine upon Latin American countries who apparently give parents no other option but to flee their homeland and end up at our borders.\n\nYet, the poverty many Americans have lived through \u2013 and are living through still \u2013 doesn\u2019t begin to scratch the surface of what these people must be trying to flee. The aching poverty, the sexual violence, the kidnapping, rising violence and oftentimes a complicit government in gang-ridden communities is overbearing \u2013 so much so that they believe they have no other option but to take their chances at our borders.\n\nI could never imagine casting my children into the wind with coyotes who have often turned out to be part of elaborate sex trafficking rings or drug cartels. I could never imagine stuffing my children in the back of overcrowded trucks in blistering hot weather conditions. But, it\u2019s a part of their constant reality.\n\nSecond, as I consider all that these people have endured and their dreams and hopes for something better in life \u2013 I\u2019m left with the lingering thought that Americans are Dreamers too.\n\nMy babies are huge dreamers. They dream of being a lawyer someday (after a very lucrative NBA career). They dream of being the first female president. My son often dreams about being a father to five plus children\u2026one day in the far-off future.\n\nI have dreams of seeing my children grow up and live productive lives. I have dreams of spoiling my little grandbabies and never allowing their little feet to touch the floor.\n\nMy friend and Angel mom, Sabine Durden, had some of those same dreams for her son Dominic, who tragically lost his life when a repeat criminal illegal collided with his motorcycle.\n\nAll of this leads me to believe it is time we start to have some really difficult conversations in this country. I believe those conversations must surround three thoughts:\n\nYes, I care about illegal immigrant children. But, not at the exclusion of my own children. Facts do matter. According to Maryann Mendoza, founder of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime, who lost her son to an illegal who hit him in a head-on collision, roughly 4,300 American citizens are killed by illegal immigrants every year. This matters to me. And newly released data from the Department of Homeland Security shows that 13 percent of DACA recipients have previous arrests, while roughly 55 percent of all approved DACA requestors had more than one arrest.\n\nYes, I care about the welfare of the children detained at U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. But, what about our own citizens? What about the growing epidemic of homeless children? What about the myriad of issues that plagues our inner cities \u2013 high crime, poor schools, and low unemployment? What about our country\u2019s debilitating opioid crisis? What about the devastating effect of MS-13 on our communities? How many of these issues have been exacerbated by open borders?\n\nYes, I care about the lives of these young people. But, what about the desolation they are fleeing? This crisis we are seeing at our southern borders is not a problem President Trump created. It is a problem that preceded him. It is the problem of the countries these people are fleeing.\n\nWe need to take a hard look at the human rights violations in countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other Latin American countries. As calls are being made that we take a hard stance against North Korea and their horrific human rights violations, some of that spotlight should also shine upon Latin American countries who apparently give parents no other option but to flee their homeland and end up at our borders.\n\nImmigration is a complex web. There are no clear solutions. There are no answers that will render us neutral. Nevertheless, we must start this conversation and we must do so by making informed, clear-eyed decisions. It\u2019s time we grow up and think like adults. Our future depends on it."

Those numbers will be based on a so-called \"quick count\" of ballots from approximately 5 percent of the more than 156,000 polling stations in Mexico. The official results will not be announced until later in the week.\n\nLopez Obrador, know popularly by the acronym \"AMLO,\" has long been the consensus front-runner in the race, having promised a \"transformation\" of a country plagued by violence and political scandal. After suffering defeats in the 2006 and 2012 presidential races, the former Mexico City mayor appeared to have won over the electorate.\n\nLopez Obrador has presented himself as a champion of poor and rural Mexicans who would root out corruption, give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. He's also promised to grant amnesties to some criminals amid a wave of violence that's the bloodiest seen in at least two decades -- and to take a reduced presidential salary.\n\nHis opponents have warned he could set Mexico back decades with an interventionist economic policy that has led previous opponents to compare him to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut while Lopez Obrador has railed against Mexico's \"mafia of power,\" he's saved some of his strongest words for Trump. He launched his presidential campaign in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and vowed that Mexico would reassert itself as a \"free, sovereign and independent\" nation. He returned to that theme Wednesday in his closing rally at the massive Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, vowing that Mexico \"will never be the pi\u00f1ata of any foreign government.\"\n\nIn between, Lopez Obrador has ripped the Trump administration's policy of separating families who cross the border illegally as \"arrogant, racist and inhuman.\" He's also vowed to roll back some of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's policies toward Central American migrants who cross Mexico's own southern border, saying that his government would no longer do Trump's \"dirty work.\"\n\nAll four presidential contenders had lambasted Trump's policies and rhetoric toward migrants and Mexico, but backlash also has landed heavily on Pena Nieto, whom critics say has not pushed back hard enough against the American president on trade, migration and the proposed border wall.\n\nDespite warnings of potential voter fraud by Lopez Obrador's allies, Sunday's voting was largely peaceful.\n\nThe government of the northern state of Chihuahua reported that three people were arrested in Ciudad Juarez for allegedly trying to buy votes for an unnamed political party.\n\nAnd in Michoacan state, polling places in a few villages were cancelled after some inhabitants said they didn't want elections involving political parties, which they mistrust. Some ballots were stolen and burned in the town of Nahuatzen to prevent voting.\n\nThe Mexico City government reported isolated problems such as polls opening late, 17 stations that ran out of ballots and the robbery of 583 ballots that were headed to a station in the borough of Iztapalapa.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Jesus and my daughter, Hayden, are the best gifts God has ever given me. My faith is something I rely on heavily.\n\nGod blessed me with His son and then He blessed me with my very own daughter to love. It's been a wonderful life.\n\nWhen I go home, I love to open the door and hear my daughter say 'Mama, Mama!' and she runs into my arms and my heart melts.\n\nShe is definitely my greatest joy. I pray daily that God blesses me with a very long life so I can watch her grow up and be there for her.\n\nI pray that she comes to know Christ at an early age and that God watches over her as she grows up in this crazy city called New York.\n\n2. I completed a half marathon in Austin, Texas. At first I told my friend there was no way I could run that far. It was actually more of a fast walk, like a shuffle.\n\nWe trained and trained and I got better and better and we did it. My leg was killing me, but I made it!\n\n3. I wore three sets of braces because my teeth were so bad. My teeth were really separated when I was young.\n\nOne set actually ended up breaking, but it all worked out and now I love my smile!\n\n4. My friend and co-worker Geraldo Rivera was one of my daughter's first babysitters, when I brought her into Fox News Channel for her first TV appearance after she was born.\n\nHe watched Hayden in the hallway outside the studio while I was inside. I remember thinking that it was so cool that Geraldo, who I used to watch on TV, was babysitting my daughter for me.\n\n5. When I was a little girl I went with my family to Washington, D.C. for a basketball tournament. My dad was the coach.\n\nWe toured the city and saw the space museum and all the monuments, including the White House.\n\nHere I am all these years later, anchoring the #1 morning show on cable news, getting an opportunity to speak to the President of the United States and visiting the Oval Office!\n\nIn her new book, The Light Within Me: An Inspirational Memoir, Ainsley offers a powerful, uplifting look at her life and her spiritual journey, reflecting on her family, her faith, and her successful career.\n\nShowing Hayden some of the pictures in my new book, \u201cThe Light Within Me,\u201d available tomorrow! #TheLightWithinMe @foxandfriends pic.twitter.com/JCyrnscJah \u2014 Ainsley Earhardt (@ainsleyearhardt) April 23, 2018\n\nSee more about your favorite Fox News hosts...\n\nJudge Jeanine\n\nTomi Lahren\n\nShannon Bream\n\nSandra Smith\n\nHarris Faulkner"

In an effort to blend in with the SUV scene it comes black cladding around the lower body and wheel wells to toughen up its otherwise sleek lines.\n\nThe idea is to get in on some of that sweet Volvo V90 Cross Country/Subaru Outback adventure lifestyle action, and they threw in a standard roof rack for good measure. Buick even lists the TourX in the SUVs & Crossovers section of its website, but with the ground clearance of a sedan, that\u2019s a stretch.\n\nIt does come standard with all-wheel-drive for $$29,995, which makes it an all-weather, if not all-terrain kind of car. The engine is a potent 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 250 hp and plenty of grunt, so the TourX can get out of its own way.\n\nIn a straight line, at least. The ride quality is indifferent. It's neither sharp-handling, nor particularly plush. Just kind of there, like in the old days.\n\nThat\u2019s OK, because this is the kind of car you fill up with family and friends and calmly cruise around in. It\u2019s reasonably quiet and has tons of legroom front and rear, courtesy of a longer wheelbase than the midsize Regal sedan, which is actually a hatchback in disguise.\n\nThe furnishings are what you expect from a Buick \u2013 a little nicer than a Chevy, not anywhere near a Cadillac \u2013 and all of the latest safety and infotainment technology is available. That includes radar cruise control, a wireless charging pouch, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and foot-activated power tailgate.\n\nAll in, the TourX costs $41,675 , which is about five thousand more than a loaded Outback, but 10 grand less than where the V90 Cross Country starts.\n\nIt\u2019s also that much cheaper than a comparably-equipped Buick Envision SUV, which is taller in height, a couple of inches shorter in length and has less cargo space than the TourX. Considering the wagon also gets better fuel economy \u2013 24 mpg combined compared to 22 mpg \u2013 you can start to see its alternative appeal.\n\nUnfortunately, some of that efficiency is courtesy of a fuel-saving engine start/stop feature that can\u2019t be disabled, but does get tiresome in stop and go traffic. Other than that, the only thing that really bothered me was the translucent shade for the panoramic sunroof that lets in too much light, while my passengers complained that the rear seat air conditioning vents weren\u2019t powerful enough. Keep in mind that both issues came up on a trip to the beach on a 90-degree day.\n\nShort of a cross-country vacation, it probably was the best way to test out an all-American family car like this one\u2026which happens to be imported from Germany, where it\u2019s built by GM\u2019s former Opel division, now owned by PSA Group.\n\nOh well, close enough.\n\n----------\n\n2018 Buick Regal TourX\n\nBase price: $29,995\n\nAs tested: $41,675\n\nType: 5-passenger, 4-door all-wheel-drive wagon\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder\n\nPower: 250 hp, 295 lb-ft\n\nTransmission: 8-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 21 city/29 hwy"

These shoes are a sure sign that it is summer and school is out.\"\n\nDuckworth also joked that the shoes mean \"there is probably no food left in my house,\u201d and that her home is consequentially filled with \u201cnoise\u2026 chaos\u2026 laughter and music\" as her sons and their friends are busy \u201clounging on my sofa, floating in my pool, playing air hockey or watching a movie somewhere.\u201d\n\nHer post then takes a sentimental turn, as she divulges that the weight of losing the boys' \"designated hang-out house\" is not lost on her.\n\nPARENTS ARE FED UP WITH KIDS' SUMMER VACATION AFTER JUST 13 DAYS, STUDY FINDS\n\n\u201cI paused outside of my door and felt a wave of sadness wash over me as I looked at these shoes\u2026 shoes from a group of kids that have been hanging out at my house for four years now,\u201d Duckworth says. \u201cThey say you only have 18 summers with your kids. I am on number 18 with mine. This realization tugs at my heart and makes me wonder how 18 summers went by so quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love having these shoes all over my porch because it means that my children are home. It means that I know where they are and who they are with and that they are all safe. I am very aware that these shoes won\u2019t be here much longer. All too soon these shoes will be scattered across different college campuses and they will be taking their first steps of independence,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd I know that all of these shoes might not find their way back home next summer as life takes them on new adventures.\u201d\n\nRECEPTIONIST SINGS 'AT LAST' OVER INTERCOM ON LAST DAY OF SCHOOL, GOES VIRAL\n\n\u201cBut for now, I will embrace these shoes and I will be so thankful for them. I will buy all the snacks. I will welcome these kids into my home and let them crash on my couches. I will soak up the sounds of their laughter and I will make them clean up all of their messes. I will pray that everyone drives home safely and I will love having a full house,\u201d she declares.\n\n\u201cSo I am going to treasure this summer of the shoes\u2026 Because I know that all too soon those shoes will be running off exploring the world\u2026 and my porch will be empty.\u201d\n\nIn the days since, Duckworth told ABC News that she is happy that her post has resonated with so many other parents feeling bittersweet as their children leave the nest.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\"Just looking at their shoes that have been sitting on my porch, it made me sad that they're all going in different directions. I know some will come home next summer and some won't,\u201d Duckworth, who also has a 20-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter, said.\n\n\u201cIt's all good and it's all part of life.\u201d"

			"text": "July Fourth is a moment for all of us to reflect on America and what it means \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true this year, as the holiday comes right after a week in politics that revealed the great challenges America\u2019s system of government is facing.\n\nThe retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2013 and the left\u2019s reaction to it \u2013 should give us all pause this Independence Day.\n\nI studied America\u2019s system of government years ago when I was an undergraduate at Oxford University. I mention that not to try and impress you with my intellectual prowess, but for the exact opposite reason. I learned practically nothing about America, despite being forced to read endless books and write endless essays on every aspect of United States governance \u2013 from the Federalist Papers to the Warren Burger Supreme Court. Somehow, it all went in one ear and out the other.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I actually lived in the U.S. that I started to understand the true genius of America\u2019s founders and what they put in place two-and-a-half centuries ago. I saw it in the way that contemporary political debates are conducted with reference to the framers\u2019 intent. I saw it in the huge importance of Supreme Court rulings \u2013 reported and debated with a prominence commensurate with the judiciary\u2019s status as a co-equal branch of government \u2013 but totally alien to someone familiar with the British system.\n\nAnd I saw the genius of the Founding Fathers most vividly of all in a family visit to Philadelphia a couple of years ago. While there, I took my two sons to the National Constitution Center, a truly wonderful place that all Americans should visit if they can.\n\nLiving in the U.S. today, and learning more about America every day, I now see the power of those distinct American virtues, and the vital role they play in politics and government, in a way that all those smart professors somehow never managed to teach me at Oxford University.\n\nThe highlight of the Constitution Center is a regular live performance telling the story of the Declaration of Independence, the Revolutionary War, the years leading up to the Constitutional Convention \u2013 and then of the momentous deliberations that produced the U.S. Constitution itself.\n\nThat performance literally moved me to tears as it brought to life in the most immediate and powerful way the beautiful idea at the heart of America: liberty under the law, an idea that had never before been expressed and guaranteed by any nation.\n\nFrom that idea, and from those incomparable founding documents, come all the things that are special about America \u2013 things that are so different to (and, frankly, so much better than) what you find where I grew up, in England. And of course vastly better than what my parents experienced where they grew up in Communist Hungary.\n\nLiving in the U.S. today, and learning more about America every day, I now see the power of those distinct American virtues, and the vital role they play in politics and government, in a way that all those smart professors somehow never managed to teach me at Oxford University.\n\nBut sadly, I also see those virtues under threat. Let\u2019s look at just a few of them.\n\nE Pluribus Unum, the founders said: from many, one. From that simple idea flows the wonderful and distinctively American idea of the melting pot, where everyone is welcome as long as they sign up to America\u2019s values and precepts: that they become Americans.\n\nThis is still a powerful force. In a recent poll, America topped the list of nations where people agreed that immigrants become accepted as \u201creal\u201d citizens.\n\nBut we have to recognize that the melting pot is cracking. Years of uncontrolled immigration \u2013 and a creeping acceptance of separatism, boosted by identity politics \u2013 risk importing the disastrous doctrine of \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d that is prevalent in Europe.\n\nIn Britain, for example, a recent government report on social cohesion highlighted closed communities of disadvantage where immigrants don\u2019t speak English, don\u2019t integrate and don\u2019t participate. While we rightly debate the immigration crisis here in America, we need to avoid an integration crisis as well.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence talked about England\u2019s \u201chistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object an absolute tyranny over these states.\u201d In response, the founders established the principle of self-government \u2013 not just by limiting the powers of government but, vitally, by decentralizing government, as enshrined in the 10th Amendment.\n\nThat virtue of decentralization has been under assault for decades by a vast, bureaucratic federal government machine that is as remote, corrupt and unaccountable as the European Union. That\u2019s why we need mechanisms like the Convention of States to return power to the people.\n\nHere\u2019s another unique American virtue, captured in the brilliant decision, hotly debated by the founders, about what to call the new head of state.\n\nThe answer: not Your Majesty, Your Excellency, or Your Highness. It is Mr. President.\n\nThe simple ways of addressing America\u2019s leader illustrates an attitude: everyone is equal under the law and nobody is better than anyone else. I believe this is one of the most important factors in America\u2019s unparalleled culture of entrepreneurialism and innovation \u2013 America\u2019s extraordinary pioneering spirit.\n\nYou just don\u2019t see that attitude anywhere else. With its hereditary monarchy and persistent class system, Britain still labors under an enterprise-killing know-your-place-culture. There\u2019s no \u201clog cabin to Buckingham Palace\u201d story in the United Kingdom.\n\nBut what\u2019s happened to America\u2019s egalitarianism today? We have a sneering elite \u2013 in Washington, in New York, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere \u2013 who really do think they are better than everyone else.\n\nAnd then finally, let\u2019s look at the one thing that underpins all these great American virtues: the Constitution.\n\nPresident Trump was duly elected according to the Constitution. But the Democratic and Republican establishments have worked nonstop to undermine his legitimacy.\n\nLook at the biggest and most consequential political event of this year the retirement of Justice Kennedy, announced Wednesday. Right after the news broke, all the talk on the left was about blocking President Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Kennedy \u2013 and the cry went out to organize, mobilize and resist.\n\nThis from the same people who seem to accuse President Trump of undermining democracy and the rule of law every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe melting pot; decentralized government; a republic of equals; a Constitution enshrining the precious ideal of people power. It is all under threat this Fourth of July \u2013 and we need to fight for it.\n\nWe\u2019ll be debating all this on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d on Fox News Channel with a fantastic line-up, including Lisa Boothe. Hope you can join us!"

After that, a man came in, looked around the room and dismissed us. That was it. My movie career was already a bust \u2013 but then I got a chance at redemption.\n\nDays later, Mr. Rubin came to visit the YMCA where I volunteered \u2013 apparently, he was still in search of the perfect country bumpkin to appear in the movie. I noticed him walking around, but I didn\u2019t catch his eye. Later, though, I saw him sitting alone in an office and I knew it was my moment to show him that I could be a star.\n\nI stuck my head in the door, awkwardly introduced myself and tried to strike up a conversation, but he barely looked up. Not to be deterred, I started talking about myself to see if it would spark his interest, but he just responded with a bored \u201cOh really?\u201d And that was the point at which I realized my personal \u201caudition\u201d was a lost cause and shut the door to the office, feeling dejected.\n\nIf I were a little younger or cuter, I would\u2019ve gotten that part, I thought many times after that, kicking myself. Later on in life, different people replaced David Rubin \u2013 in high school, I sought the approval of the popular girls. In college, it was my pastors. In law school, it was the law firm recruiters who interviewed us for summer jobs.\n\nThose people had power over me \u2013 power over my mood, my sense of self-worth, my dreams \u2013 and they had that power because I didn\u2019t know where I stopped and they began. I didn\u2019t have boundaries between my aspirations and their approval. Basically, they were the idols I worshipped.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your approval idol is \u2013 social media stardom, a pat on the back from your boss, an invitation from someone you admire \u2013 but Jesus said that if you live by the sword, you\u2019ll die by the sword (Matthew 26:52). So if you\u2019re going to live for the approval of others, know this: that need is sharp and dangerous and it will drain you of your lifeblood, one incision at a time.\n\nIn the end, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get a loving spouse, overachieving kids, lots of Facebook likes, a part in a movie, whatever. And after gaining what you thought was the whole world, you\u2019ll eventually look in the mirror and realize that you lost a big chunk of your soul trying to keep your idol applauding for you (Matthew 16:26).\n\nIt isn\u2019t worth it. Let\u2019s lay our lives down at the feet of the humble God who gave His life to prove we could trust Him. In the end, it will be His \u201cwell done\u201d that really matters (Matthew 25:14-30)."

			"text": "As pharma companies underwrite three-fourths of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s budget for scientific reviews, the agency is increasingly fast-tracking expensive drugs with significant side effects and unproven health benefits.\n\nNuplazid, a drug for hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, failed two clinical trials. In a third trial, under a revised standard for measuring its effect, it showed minimal benefit. Overall, more patients died or had serious side effects on Nuplazid than after receiving no treatment.\n\nPatients on Uloric, a gout drug, suffered more heart attacks, strokes and heart failure in two out of three trials than did their counterparts on standard or no medication.\n\nNevertheless, the FDA approved both of these drugs \u2014 with a deadly aftermath. Uloric\u2019s manufacturer reported last November that patients on the drug were 34 percent more likely to die from heart disease than people taking an alternative gout medication. And since the FDA fast-tracked approval of Nuplazid and it went on the market in 2016 at a price of $24,000 a year, there have been 6,800 reports of adverse events for patients on the drug, including 887 deaths as of this past March 31.\n\nThe FDA is increasingly green-lighting expensive drugs despite dangerous or little-known side effects and inconclusive evidence that they curb or cure disease. Once widely assailed for moving slowly, today the FDA reviews and approves drugs faster than any other regulatory agency in the world. Between 2011 and 2015, the FDA reviewed new drug applications more than 60 days faster on average than did the European Medicines Agency.\n\nEurope has also rejected drugs for which the FDA accelerated approval, such as Folotyn, which treats a rare form of blood cancer. European authorities cited \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence of health gains from Folotyn, which shrinks some tumors but hasn\u2019t been shown to extend lives. It costs more than $92,000 for a seven-week course of treatment, according to research firm SSR Health.\n\nAs patients (or their insurers) shell out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for unproven drugs, manufacturers reap a windfall. For them, expedited approval can mean not only sped-up sales but also \u2014 if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or serve a neglected population \u2014 FDA incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cInstead of a regulator and a regulated industry, we now have a partnership,\u201d said Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group for the nonprofit advocacy organization Public Citizen, and a former U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official. \u201cThat relationship has tilted the agency away from a public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat relationship has tilted the agency away from a public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective.\u201d - Dr. Michael Carome\n\nWhile the FDA over the past three decades has implemented at least four major routes to faster approvals \u2014 the current commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, is easing even more drugs\u2019 path to market. The FDA okayed 46 \u201cnovel\u201d drugs \u2014 whose chemical structure hadn\u2019t been previously approved \u2014 in 2017, the most in at least 15 years. At the same time, it\u2019s rejecting fewer medications. In 2017, the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research denied 19.7 percent of all applications for new drugs, biologics, and efficacy supplements, down from a 2010 peak of 59.2 percent, according to agency data.\n\nPresident Trump has encouraged Gottlieb to give patients faster access to drugs. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing that down, right?\u201d Trump asked the commissioner at a May 30 event, referring to the time it takes to bring drugs to market. \u201cYou have a lot of good things in the wings that, frankly, if you moved them up, a lot of people would have a great shot.\u201d\n\nFaster reviews mean that the FDA often approves drugs despite limited information. It channels more and more experimental treatments, including Nuplazid, into expedited reviews that require only one clinical trial to show a benefit to patients, instead of the traditional two.\n\nThe FDA also increasingly allows drugmakers to claim success in trials based on proxy measurements \u2014 such as shrunken tumors \u2014 instead of clinical outcomes like survival rates or cures, which take more time to evaluate. In return for accelerated approval, drug companies commit to researching how well their drugs work after going on the market. But these post-marketing studies can take 10 years or longer to complete, leaving patients and doctors with lingering questions about safety and benefit.\n\n\u201cOnce you have that paying relationship, it creates a dynamic that\u2019s not a healthy one.\u201d - Dr. Jerry Avorn\n\n\u201cClearly, accelerated approval has greater uncertainty,\u201d Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in an interview. When only a single trial is used for approval, \u201cin some cases, there may be more uncertainty about safety findings or with the magnitude of effectiveness.\u201d\n\nShe attributed the increased use of expedited pathways to more drugmakers developing treatments for rare diseases, \u201cwhere there\u2019s unmet need, and where the patient population and providers are eager to accept more uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s growing emphasis on speed has come at the urging of both patient advocacy groups and industry, which began in 1992 to contribute to the salaries of the agency\u2019s drug reviewers in exchange for time limits on reviews. In 2017, pharma paid 75 percent \u2014 or $905 million \u2014 of the agency\u2019s scientific review budgets for branded and generic drugs, compared to 27 percent in 1993.\n\n\u201cThe virginity was lost in \u201992,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cOnce you have that paying relationship, it creates a dynamic that\u2019s not a healthy one.\u201d\n\nRead the entire story at ProPublica.org.\n\n"

			"text": "A left-wing populist who has railed against President Trump's immigration policies in no uncertain terms appeared to have won a comprehensive victory in Mexico's presidential election Sunday night, with both of his main rivals conceding before the first official results were announced.\n\nOne exit poll, conducted by Consulta Mitofsky for broadcaster Televisa, showed Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador with a 16 to 26 percent lead over his nearest rival, conservative Ricardo Anaya.\n\nIn a televised speech, Anaya acknowledged that \"the trend favors Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\" and said \"I recognize his triumph.\"\n\nJose Antonio Meade of the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) placed third in the exit polls and delivered his own concession speech acknowledging Lopez Obrador's victory soon after.\n\n\"For the good of Mexico, I wish him the greatest success,\" Meade said.\n\n\n\nOther exit polls projected that Lopez Obrador's left-wing Morena party would win governorships in the states of Chiapas, Morelos, Tabasco and Veracruz, as well as the race for head of government in Mexico City.\n\nElection officials were expected to announce preliminary results later Sunday night. Those numbers will be based on a so-called \"quick count\" of ballots from approximately 5 percent of the more than 156,000 polling stations in Mexico. The official results will not be announced until later in the week.\n\nLopez Obrador, know popularly by the acronym \"AMLO,\" has long been the consensus front-runner in the race, having promised a \"transformation\" of a country plagued by violence and political scandal. After suffering defeats in the 2006 and 2012 presidential races, the former Mexico City mayor appeared to have won over the electorate.\n\nLopez Obrador has presented himself as a champion of poor and rural Mexicans who would root out corruption, give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. He's also promised to grant amnesties to some criminals amid a wave of violence that's the bloodiest seen in at least two decades -- and to take a reduced presidential salary.\n\nHis opponents have warned he could set Mexico back decades with an interventionist economic policy that has led previous opponents to compare him to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.\n\nBut while Lopez Obrador has railed against Mexico's \"mafia of power,\" he's saved some of his strongest words for Trump. He launched his presidential campaign in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and vowed that Mexico would reassert itself as a \"free, sovereign and independent\" nation. He returned to that theme Wednesday in his closing rally at the massive Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, vowing that Mexico \"will never be the pi\u00f1ata of any foreign government.\"\n\nIn between, Lopez Obrador has ripped the Trump administration's policy of separating families who cross the border illegally as \"arrogant, racist and inhuman.\" He's also vowed to roll back some of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's policies toward Central American migrants who cross Mexico's own southern border, saying that his government would no longer do Trump's \"dirty work.\"\n\nAll four presidential contenders had lambasted Trump's policies and rhetoric toward migrants and Mexico, but backlash also has landed heavily on Pena Nieto, whom critics say has not pushed back hard enough against the American president on trade, migration and the proposed border wall.\n\nDespite warnings of potential voter fraud by Lopez Obrador's allies, Sunday's voting was largely peaceful.\n\nThe government of the northern state of Chihuahua reported that three people were arrested in Ciudad Juarez for allegedly trying to buy votes for an unnamed political party.\n\nAnd in Michoacan state, polling places in a few villages were cancelled after some inhabitants said they didn't want elections involving political parties, which they mistrust. Some ballots were stolen and burned in the town of Nahuatzen to prevent voting.\n\nThe Mexico City government reported isolated problems such as polls opening late, 17 stations that ran out of ballots and the robbery of 583 ballots that were headed to a station in the borough of Iztapalapa.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

			"text": "Staff writer Selene San Felice was working on a story when a loud bang shattered the typical office noise of keyboards, phone calls and the occasional shout that a story was finished.\n\nSan Felice heard the shots and made a break for the back door. It wouldn't open.\n\nIt had been barricaded as part of a targeted attack aimed specifically to kill Capital Gazette staffers. Staff members hid under desks and did everything they could to stay silent for fear the shooter would discover them.\n\nThere were 11 people in the Capital Gazette's newsroom Thursday. Five were killed. Six other newsroom employees were on vacation, out of the office or done with work for the day. Advertising representatives were in Baltimore for a meeting.\n\nRob Hiaasen, 59; Gerald Fischman, 61; Wendi Winters, 65; John McNamara, 56; and Rebecca Smith, 34, were killed in the attack. Hiaasen, Fischman, Winters and McNamara were editors. Smith was a sales associate who worked near the front door. All were beloved by their co-workers.\n\n\"I heard the first shot and heard a yell,\" San Felice said, who hid with Capital Gazette intern Anthony Messenger. \"By the second shot and the third shot, I knew what it was. That is when I picked up my purse and said, 'I'm leaving.' I knew that was selfish. I knew something bad was happening.\"\n\nA man armed with a pump-action shotgun blasted his way into the office Thursday and fired on Capital Gazette staff members. The newsroom has a long, L-shaped walkway that connects the advertising desks, the newsroom and the back of the office where sports and government reporters sit.\n\nThe shooter had a clear path and vision of the entire office.\n\nJarrod Warren Ramos, 38, has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bond.\n\nRamos had a long-held grudge with the Capital Gazette that began in July 2011 after the paper ran a column about a criminal harassment case in which he was involved. He unsuccessfully sued the paper for defamation.\n\nReporters who survived the attack recalled hiding under their desks or scrambling for the back door.\n\nThey heard shouts of \"No\" and \"Oh God\" just before a shotgun blast and then silence. And then another shotgun blast.\n\nOne reporter \u2014 who was near one of the editors killed \u2014 said it sounded like labored breathing. Then he stopped.\n\nStaff writer Phil Davis heard the blasts and recalled thinking it was a shotgun. His desk has a filing cabinet along the alleyway where the shooter walked, concealing Davis.\n\nA colleague was shot just feet away. Other reporters \u2014 friends he would enjoy drinks with after work \u2014 were hiding a row of desks away.\n\n\"I heard a woman scream,\" Davis said. \"The shots were getting closer as he was walking up the alley to the back door and shooting people on the way. I knew someone was killed or very hurt. There were shots after he reloaded. He reloaded the shells individually. I stayed under my desk hoping he didn't hear me.\"\n\nStaff writer Rachael Pacella had received a request from Hiaasen when she heard the shots and immediately went to hide. She changed her mind and made a break for the back door. But she tripped and smashed her face on the wall.\n\nShe suffered a concussion, a cut on her face and bruises. She was bleeding heavily while she scrambled near San Felice and Messenger who were hiding in the rear section of the room.\n\n\"The whole place smelled like gunpowder,\" Pacella said. \"When I was hiding, I saw a flashlight shine on the floor, six feet in front of me. That was terrifying. If it was a police officer, they didn't announce themselves . I thought it was the guy.\n\n\"A lot of it was focusing on surviving and keeping my breath quiet. I knew I needed to be as quiet as I could be.\"\n\nPhotojournalist Paul W. Gillespie was at his desk editing photos when the shots rang out.\n\nHe hid under his desk and \"curled up as small as I could,\" he said. He heard his co-workers shout before they were shot.\n\n\"I dove under that desk as fast as I could and, by the grace of God, he didn't look over there,\" he said. \"I was curled up, trying not to breathe, trying not to make a sound, and he shot people all around me.\"\n\nAfter a lull in the shooting \u2014 possibly when Davis heard the shooter reload \u2014 Gillespie made a break for the front door. He jumped over the body of a dead co-worker and made it outside.\n\nPolice arrived about a minute after the shooting began, though survivors said it felt longer. They swept through the office and gathered up Pacella, Davis, Messenger and San Felice. Police moved toward the front of the newsroom and left out the front door. Pacella wasn't wearing shoes \u2014 she couldn't recall if she already had them off or ran out of them \u2014 so an officer carried her across the broken glass of the front door.\n\nThe officers told them not to look.\n\n\"In walking forward, we had to walk over an editor,\" San Felice said.\n\nDavis said he was separated from his colleagues after police arrived. He went with another officer to help him get access to different parts of the building with his key card. Davis then asked the officer if he could get his phone to call his parents. He had to walk over a body multiple times.\n\n\"I had a family member die from being shot 20 years ago,\" Davis said. \"I didn't have to walk over his dead body. It is a different feeling when it happens around you. You are helpless. You are hopeless. To then walk over the bodies of those people who were shot for something they had nothing to do with, it is probably something I'll never be able to walk away from. I feel so terribly for everyone's family.\"\n\nSan Felice \u2014 who returned to work a day after the shooting \u2014 told editors and publishers she wanted people to know that something had to change, that these homicides cannot become another forgotten fact.\n\nSan Felice appeared on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360 \" where she cursed and said: \"I'm going to need more than a couple days of news coverage and some thoughts and prayers because our whole lives have been shattered.\"\n\nThose comments drew praise from many. But it also drew out the worst in people.\n\nSome of those critics told San Felice in messages Friday she should have died in the attack.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to die for a level of decency to be upheld,\" San Felice said. \"We will never ever get back people like Rob, Gerald, Wendi and John and Rebecca.\"\n\n___\n\nBaltimore Sun reporters Kevin Rector and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Capital, http://www.capitalgazette.com/"

			"text": "article\n\nU.S. stocks finished mostly higher Friday, but they surrendered most of an early gain as worries about rising tariffs once again dampened investors' enthusiasm as the second quarter came to an end.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBanks led the early rally. The Federal Reserve gave the green light for most large U.S. financial institutions to pay bigger dividends to shareholders and buy back more stock. Apparel maker Nike surged after it said sales in North America improved in its latest quarter, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a gain of around 293 points near midday.\n\nThose gains eroded as investors again focused on U.S. trade policy, which has overhung the market since late February. Canada announced $12.6 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. General Motors warned that if the Trump administration places import taxes on cars and car parts, it will likely face retaliation and might have to eliminate jobs in the U.S.\n\nAt the close, the Dow's gain was 55.36 points, or 0.2 percent, at 24,271.41. The S&P 500 index edged up 2.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,718.37. The Nasdaq composite rose 6.62 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,510.30. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,643.07. All four indexes ended the second three months of the year with gains with the Russell having the strongest showing, up 7.4 percent.\n\nOn Friday, Wells Fargo gained 3.4 percent to $55.44, its biggest gain since shortly after the 2016 Presidential election.\n\nThe gain came after the Federal Reserve allowed 32 of the 35 largest banks in the U.S. to raise their quarterly dividends and buy back more stock. The central bank determined that those institutions are in good enough financial shape to weather a major downturn in the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Fed's \"stress tests\" measure a bank's financial health and are separate from its business tactics, investors felt the Fed's approval was a notable win for Wells. Earlier this year the Fed placed numerous restrictions on the bank in response to abusive practices that duped consumers out of millions of dollars.\n\nNike said revenue in North America grew after several quarters of declines, and its fourth-quarter profit and sales blew past Wall Street forecasts. The athletic apparel company also said it will buy back $15 billion in stock over the next four years. It gained 11.1 percent to $79.68, its biggest surge in almost four years.\n\nWith trade tensions in focus throughout the second quarter, stocks didn't make big gains, even after a very strong round of first-quarter corporate reports. The S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent over those three months and the Dow added just 0.7 percent.\n\nInvestors felt technology companies and smaller, more U.S.-focused companies were safe picks in case the trade tensions get worse. The Nasdaq composite jumped 6.3 percent and the Russell 2000 index advanced 7.4 percent. Both set records as recently as last week.\n\nThe Dow is the only major index still lower for the year, though only down 0.6 percent.\n\nOnly a week remains before the U.S. and China each place tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in imports. Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy for TD Ameritrade, said the outcome of the broader trade tensions will help determine what stocks do in the months to come. He said stocks might set more records if the situation is resolved in a way the market likes, but if the tensions end up hurting global economic growth, stocks could fall further.\n\nEnergy companies and oil prices continued to climb. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 1 percent to $74.15 a barrel in New York and rose 14 percent during the second quarter, to its highest price since late 2014. The S&P 500 index of energy companies climbed almost 13 percent this quarter, far better than the rest of the market and its biggest gain in six and a half years.\n\nBrent crude, used to price international oils, rose 1.9 percent to $79.44 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline climbed 2.2 percent to $2.18 a gallon. Heating oil jumped 1.4 percent to $2.21 a gallon. Natural gas lost 0.5 percent to $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nBond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.86 percent from 2.84 percent.\n\nGold added 0.3 percent to $1,254.50 an ounce. Silver gained 1 percent to $16.20 an ounce. Copper fell 0.2 percent to $2.97 a pound.\n\nThe dollar rose to 110.85 yen from 110.64 yen. The euro rose to $1.1672 from $1.1555.\n\nFrance's CAC 40 gained 1.1 percent and the German DAX added 0.9 percent after a deal on migration relieved pressure on the coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.3 percent.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged 0.2 percent higher. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay"

Nine people, including six children, were stabbed, some with life-threatening injuries.\n\nThirty-year-old Timmy Kinner of Los Angeles has been charged with several felonies in connection with the attack. Police say he briefly stayed at the apartment complex but was recently asked to leave because of behavior problems.\n\nKinner is an American, but the apartment complex is home to many refugee families and refugees from Iraq, Syria and Ethiopia were among the victims.\n\nA candlelight vigil is planned for 6 p.m. Monday on the steps of Boise's City Hall.

He said all of the victims will be forever scarred by the physical and emotional injuries they sustained.\n\nThirty-year-old Timmy Kinner of Los Angeles has been charged with several felonies in connection with the attack. Police say he briefly stayed at the apartment complex but was recently asked to leave because of behavior problems.\n\nPolice say Kinner returned to the complex on Saturday and began stabbing children who were attending a birthday party. Three adults who tried to intervene were also stabbed.\n\n___\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nPolice say the suspect in a mass stabbing at an Idaho apartment complex had only been in Boise a short time when the attack occurred Saturday night.\n\nBoise Police Chief William Bones said 30-year-old Timmy Kinner has an extensive criminal record in multiple states. He declined to provide details other than to say it included violent crimes, substance abuse and prison time.\n\nHe said Kinner was invited to stay at the low-income apartment complex by a resident who had recently met him. Bones said the resident wanted to give him a helping hand in return for the help she had received from others in the past.\n\nThe resident was not among the victims, though several members of refugee families were. Kinner is an American, but the apartment complex houses many refugee families from Syria, Iraq, Ethiopia and Somalia.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nPolice say the nine victims of a stabbing attack at a Boise, Idaho, apartment complex included refugee families from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia.\n\nThe victims included six children who were attending a birthday party at the apartment complex Saturday night. Three adults were also injured while trying to help the children.\n\nPolice Chief William Bones said Sunday that 30-year-old Timmy Kinner has been charged with several felonies. Bones said Kinner had been temporarily staying with a resident of the complex but had been asked to leave on Friday because of problems with his behavior.\n\nMegan Schwab with the International Rescue Committee said the violent attack may compound the existing trauma already experienced by the refugee families, many of whom fled war and conflict in hopes of finding safety in the U.S.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nBoise, Idaho, police say the suspect in a mass stabbing that injured nine people had targeted a three-year-old girl's birthday party.\n\nPolice Chief William Bones said Sunday that the birthday girl was among the injured, as were five other children aged four to 12.

Bones said all are alive, although some are gravely injured.\n\nBones said a resident of the apartment complex where the stabbing took place had allowed 30-year-old Timmy Kinner to stay there a short time, but asked him to leave Friday because of his behavior.\n\nPolice say Kinner returned Saturday, when the girl was having her party a few doors down from where he had stayed.\n\nThe complex houses many resettled refugee families, but Kinner is not a refugee.\n\n___\n\n9:45 a.m.\n\nIdaho police have identified the suspect in a mass stabbing at a Boise apartment complex as a temporary resident who was recently asked to leave the complex.\n\nNine people were injured in the Saturday night attack, including six children. Police say four of the victims have life-threatening injuries, but all were still alive Sunday morning.\n\nThirty-year-old Timmy Kinner is facing nine counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child.\n\nThe Boise Police Department said in a prepared statement that they believe Kinner, from Los Angeles, was a temporary resident of the apartment complex but had been asked to leave on Friday. The complex houses many resettled refugee families, but Kinner is not a refugee. Police said they do not yet have an exact motive for the attack.\n\n___\n\n11:00 p.m. SATURDAY\n\nIdaho police say nine people are hospitalized and one man is in custody after a mass stabbing at a Boise apartment complex that is home to many refugee families.\n\nThe police did not yet have a suspected motive for the Saturday night attack but said a 30-year-old man was in custody.\n\nAll nine victims were found inside the apartment complex and in the parking lot, and included some refugees who live in the complex.

Incorporated into their TRUST line of armor, there is a wide range available from helmets, chest, back and knuckle armor through to elbow, knee and foot protection. Orange goo-fortified options can shield you head to toe against blunt force trauma.\n\nSure, the raw material looks, and feels, like very orange Silly Putty. But this advanced material is the key to ultra-lightweight body armor that feels like you are wearing regular apparel.\n\nThis orange goo is so powerful it only requires a thin layer to deliver incredible protection.\n\nTANK-KILLING ROBOT REVEALED\n\nBlunt force trauma to the abdomen can be dangerous. A swing of a tire iron at your belly could lead to possible abdominal organ contusions and ruptures \u2014 D3O armor can absorb that sort of strike and reduce those injuries.\n\nA serious blow to the head could mean concussion or even death. D3O helmet liners absorb the impact, take the beating for you, and reduce these serious risks.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe TRUST armor is soft and flexible until it gets struck. At impact, the goo stiffens, providing a shield to absorb the attack.\n\nThe result? The amount of force transmitted to your body is greatly reduced and a wearer will not feel the blow \u2014 or at least experience a significantly reduced impact. Once the blow is absorbed, the goo-infused apparel goes back to its soft, flexible, smushy mode.\n\nWhat is it made of?\n\nThe D3O secret sauce is proprietary and highly sophisticated, employing advanced polymer chemistry. On the most simplistic level, molecules move about freely in the soft material. When hit, the molecules lock, absorbing and dispersing the energy from the impact. The molecules then return to moving freely and the material becomes flexible again.\n\nPODCAST: WHAT CAN KILL YOU WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT? THIS SPECIAL FORCES SHARPSHOOTER REVEALS HIDDEN DANGERS IN BACKYARDS AND WAR ZONES\n\nHow could the orange goo protect U.S. police?\n\nEvery year, law enforcement and military members are assaulted and subjected to blunt force in the line of duty.\n\nNEW FUTURISTIC ISRAELI 'DUNE-BUGGY' IS BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS, READY FOR COMBAT\n\nPatrolling on foot, catching criminals, physical dispute intervention, public disorder incidents, traffic stops, searches and suspects who resist capture are just a few of the many ways police officers can end up suffering a blunt force trauma injury.\n\nThose who serve our nation deserve every possible protection \u2014and they need protection that won\u2019t hinder their ability to do their job. They need light protection that doesn\u2019t slow them down or inhibit movement.\n\nD3O\u2019s bright orange goo helps achieve both protection and unrestricted movement at the same time. Unlike traditional heavy, clunky, hot, awkward-fitting armor, the TRUST armor is a comfortable armor to wear because it bends, stretches and breathes with smart air flow designs \u2014 while still providing a high degree of protection from the sort of blunt force trauma that commonly occurs.\n\nSome scenarios will require maximum ballistic protection, but in other scenarios with a different threat assessment, the conventional heavy armor may not be necessary and a lighter, less restrictive armor could be a better solution.\n\nThe \u2018James Bond\u2019 Factor\n\nSince mere millimeters of thickness can provide serious protection, it also means G3O is a great choice for undercover or covert type work. It can be worn under regular clothes, and deliver low profile, if not invisible, protection.\n\nWho uses this armor?\n\nSo far, elite military teams like U.S. Special Forces have been leveraging D3O for body protection.\n\nFORMIDABLE 'JAGUAR' RECON VEHICLE REVEALED, TOUTS POWERFUL CANNON AND ANTI-TANK MISSILES\n\nAllies such as France and Great Britain have been exploring its potential in military and policing applications.\n\nG1 Knuckle Protection\n\nThe D3O orange goo can be integrated into gloves to discreetly provide enhanced protection. There are several options available for different protection levels and task.\n\nHand dexterity is vital in defense and law enforcement for weapon handling, of course, but also many, many other tasks. Fit and flexibility are key factors to maintain dexterity, so the G1 has multiple flex points incorporated and thin and light protection built in.\n\nD3O\u2019s research suggests that when fingers are hit with blunt force, the innovative orange material provides a whopping 50 percent better reduction in the amount of force that reaches the fingers than other protective gloves available on the market.\n\nPODCAST: THIS GEORGIA BOY STOPPED THE MILITARY\u2019S #2 AND #3 MOST WANTED \u2013 FIND OUT HOW FROM THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS WARRIOR HIMSELF\n\nTRUST Vest\n\nThe futuristic looking TRUST Vest armor worn beneath a regular shirt will basically be unnoticeable.\n\nEUROSATORY 2018: POCKET-SIZED SPY DRONE IS A POWERFUL EYE IN THE SKY FOR US TROOPS\n\nIn practice, this means if you\u2019re wearing a vest protecting your stomach, the orange goo inside the vest will absorb a punch, a thrown brick \u2014 even the impact of a tire iron swung at you.\n\nThe TRUST Vest meets the British HOSDB Blunt Trauma Protector standard and incorporates flame resistant fabric.\n\nEnhancing Helmet Protection\n\nIf you have a helmet with these astonishing orange goo liners, then you could have a chair smashed over your head and the goo will absorb the blow for you.\n\nD3O has created TRUST helmet pads for many military and law enforcement helmet development programs like the U.S. Army\u2019s Enhanced Combat Helmet.\n\nThe seven-component TRUST helmet liner system weighs 13.65 grams and includes a 14-millimeter thick trap pad.\n\nEUROSATORY 2018: HUGE WHEELED MILITARY ATV SWIMS AND SURPRISES\n\nBased on company research, the Helmet Liner System provides 33 percent more protection than the level required for the U.S. Army Advanced Combat Helmet tests at 10ft/sec.\n\n3M Ceradyne\u2019s new military Ultra-Light Weight Ballistic and Bump Helmet, with advanced protection against ballistic penetration and fragmentation as well as blunt force trauma, incorporates D3O\u2019s amazing materials.\n\nFootball, Baseball and Beyond\n\nThere are countless other military and law enforcement applications for this remarkable innovation, such as better protection above the foot from a blow and better shock absorption below to reduce fatigue and injury.\n\nThe bright orange goo could also be used to reduce impact injury in vehicles and to protect mission electronics from impact and vibration.\n\nWhen D3O first launched, it immediately caught the interest of top Hollywood stuntmen, who recognized it could provide much-needed relief from their regular beatings at work.\n\nFUTURISTIC MINI-SUB COULD BE A VALUABLE WEAPON FOR NAVY SEALS\n\nPartnerships, like the D3O liner integration into Schutt\u2019s sports helmets, have helped to make access to this remarkable innovation more available to civilians.\n\nNow, football, lacrosse and baseball players can benefit from this advanced trauma protection too. The amazing goo is also now available in protective apparel for other high impact popular sports like motorcycle racing, mountain biking and snowboarding."

With the slogan \u2018Fight for Freedom\u2019 the 75,000 people present and the millions of viewers (via TV and streaming) are asked to stand up for peace, freedom and an inclusive society.\"\n\nA post shared by Liberty Concerts (@libertyconcerts) on Jun 8, 2018 at 8:06am PDT\n\nThe organizers said that as they developed the concert idea, they spoke with \"several\" veterans who would be \"guests of honor at the event.\"\n\n\"Next year we will invite them to come to the concert for free, attend the concert in the VIP-area and experience how artists and youth will show respect to them,\" the group said. \" Some of them will also be on stage to say or do something shortly.\"\n\nD-DAY REMEMBERED: THE DAY WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO WIN\n\nHowever, some veterans and their families said they were outraged at the planned festivities, with some people starting an online petition looking to \"remember D-Day respectfully.\" The petition has drawn more than 2,400 signatures.\n\n\"When I found out about the concert I was horrified really, to think that on 6 June, the anniversary of D-Day, so many troops died on the beaches. Not only British troops, but Canadians, French, Americans, Dutch and other nationalities died on those beaches,\" 95-year-old veteran Joe Cattini told Sky News. \"The beaches are, on that day of all days, sacred. They shouldn't be violated by pop concerts.\"\n\nCattini told Sky News he visits the beaches and the surrounding villages every year on June 6 with other veterans to remember his friends who died there.\n\n\"Have it a bit further inland, not on the beach itself. It's rather bad taste,\" he told Sky News.\n\nDame Vera Lynn, an English singer known as \"The Forces\u2019 Sweetheart,\" recently severed ties with the concert organizers. Virginia Lewis-Jones, Lynn's daughter, told The Telegraph last month that her 101-year-old mother had \"no idea\" what kind of event it was going to be when she originally signed up.\n\nWHAT D-DAY TEACHES US ABOUT PRAYER\n\nA statement released on behalf of Lynn to The Express said that she was \"always keen to support charitable endeavors, especially those that benefit veterans.\"\n\nThe organizers, however, claimed the event would \"ensure that the lives of fallen soldiers will not be forgotten with the next generation.\"\n\n\"We believe the best way to share the powerful legacy of sacrifice is by bringing young people near to the place where this history happened, as it creates an unforgettable moment in their lives,\" the group wrote on its website. \"We think the symbolic function of this day and this beach helps to touch the hearts of millions of people.\""

The veteran goalkeeper leapt up, punched the air with both hands and leapt into a surfing, belly flop dive on to the rain-soaked turf as teammates raced to him from the halfway line.\n\nThe World Cup's lowest-ranked team now advances a quarterfinal against Croatia or Denmark in Sochi on Sunday.\n\n\"I just feel emptied out,\" Akinfeev said. \"Over the whole second half and extra time we were defending our goal and managed it, we were hoping for penalties because Spain are hard to beat. Spain can't always be lucky.\"\n\nIt gave Russia its greatest win in international soccer for 10 years, since Akinfeev was in goal for an extra-time victory over the Netherlands in a European Championship quarterfinal. That run was ended days later by a Spain team beginning its era of dominance.\n\nSpain has now failed to win a knockout game at three major tournaments since it won Euro 2012.\n\nDefeat Sunday likely spells the end of Andres Iniesta's career. The veteran Barcelona midfielder came off the bench and almost won the game with an 85th-minute shot well saved by Akinfeev. Iniesta also scored the first spot-kick of the shootout.\n\nSpain was more urgent in extra time after being too passive when it dominated the ball in the 90 minutes of regular time.\n\nAkinfeev pushed away a 109th-minute shot from substitute Rodrigo who ran hard at goal from near the halfway line. He also ensured the game needed 30 extra minutes with back-to-back diving saves in the 85th to deny substitutes Iniesta and Aspas.\n\nSpain dominated the ball during the game \u2014 completing more than 1,000 passes \u2014 but was too passive against a well-organized Russian defense.\n\nSpain led in the 12th minute when captain Sergio Ramos helped force Russia's Sergei Ignashevich into an own goal when his back was turned to the play. The 38-year-old defender diverted a crossed ball into the net with his heel as he and Ramos got tangled up.\n\nAn error in Spain's defense let Russia level in the 41st, after Gerard Pique's raised arm blocked a header by Artyom Dzyuba at a corner. Pique's complaints were wasted. Referees and video officials have consistently penalized handballs in the box at this World Cup.\n\nDzyuba's penalty kick fooled goalkeeper David De Gea to dive the wrong way."

Trump said he plans to interview one or two candidates on Saturday or Sunday before announcing his nominee after the Fourth of July. \"I've got it narrowed to about five,\" he said, including two women.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of The Weekly Standard Steve Hayes joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss who could be replacing Justice Kennedy.\n\nOn Supreme Court nominee possibilities Lisa Murkowski actually has some leverage here. She's certainly one of the most important, I would argue, two or three senators to President Trump's pick. But President Trump has said repeatedly that he will pick just from this list. He suggested this afternoon that he had in his head sort of narrowed it down to five people. (1:00)\n\nOn Trump sticking to list: Certainly if you talk to people in and around the White House they will say he is sticking to the list. You will get strong pushback from the White House and people who are advising when you suggest that he may go off the the list. Again, nothing is locked in because he's an ad hoc president. Judging from the way people are getting this pushback I think it's pretty safe to assume he will stick to the list. (4:40)\n\nOn Putin meeting: If we were advising a traditional conservative president we would want this president to go in and be very forceful with Putin, both in terms of his destabilization of the Middle East, his interference in Syria, what he did in Ukraine and in particular confront him about meddling in elections. I don't have confidence. (6:03).\n\nOn Wisconsin governor's race: Scott walker I think is in some ways lucky because he is facing a Democratic field that is terribly splintered and there aren't very many good Democrats. I would say Walker is sort of the odds on favorite right now. He's very polarizing. The state is very divided. If Democrats could settle on a candidate who could really make a case then he could be in trouble. (10:07)\n\nOn Charles Krauthammer: It wasn't an easy piece to write and it feels totally inadequate. I wrote one other of appreciation of Charles last week. I feel like I haven't really captured him but i guess I'm never really going to. He was a fantastic colleague and a terrific friend.

Within weeks, users will be notified whether or not their microbiome is in balance or not and then they are given a list of recommended foods and ones to avoid.\n\nWhile the technology has not been approved by the FDA, it has been green-lighted by an Independent Research Bureau, Jain says."

That has triggered global worries about how the curtailing of free trade might hurt economies and industrial sectors, but markets are still unsure of what the impact might be. On Friday, China started giving foreign companies more access to auto manufacturing, insurance and other fields.

It\u2019s ugly and it's disheartening to watch.\n\nI have some Final Thoughts.\n\nWhether it's Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders getting kicked out of a restaurant, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Cho being shouted down by students, protesters harassing DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant, or having water thrown at me while I brunched with my parents - one thing is for sure: The so-called \u201cloving and tolerant left\u201d seems to be anything but.\n\nAnd it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nWhere are the feminists in all of this? Conservative women are attacked verbally - even physically - and the female empowerment squad is nowhere to be found. Do conservative women mean less to you? Are we not worthy of your advocacy? If so, I feel sorry for you.\n\nWhere does it end? Are we on the fast track to Democratic-only restaurants and public spaces? Is that what some of you want? Are you so intimidated by opposing viewpoints you have to silence, shame and shout down those of us who don\u2019t subscribe to your world view? Are you so unconfident in your argument you need to resort to harassment and isolation?\n\nThat's weakness.\n\nConservatives aren\u2019t off the hook either. It bothers me to my very core when some storeowners turn customers away for being gay, or otherwise different. Yes, I\u2019m all for religious liberty. But the courts and the Constitution aside, can we just treat people like people?\n\nTomi Lahren's Final Thoughts on Trip to U.S.-Mexico Border: 'The Left Is Unfairly Demonizing Border Patrol Agents'\n\nTomi Lahren on CA: The Golden State Is 'Turning Into a Golden Disaster'\n\nWe are blessed to live in a country with freedom of speech and expression. Generations of Americans \u2014 of all races, genders and ethnicities \u2014 fought and died for our First Amendment rights. We don\u2019t have to like or agree with one another, but we can respect each other as people.\n\nWe live in a political climate so heated and divided that we completely shut off reason, and tune out the other side. \u201cWho did you vote for?\u201d becomes the litmus test for friendship. If we don\u2019t like the answer, we shut down.\n\nWe\u2019ve been taught to avoid talking about politics and religion, which has led to a lack of understanding of how to navigate difficult conversations. We\u2019ve become so unreasonable and stubborn, we ostracize or attack those who don\u2019t think like we do.\n\nListen, I have strong opinions. And yes, I\u2019ve SAID things that have crossed the line.\n\nBUT I would never call for my political opponents to be harassed, attacked, or asked to leave a restaurant. I am confident enough in my argument to be around people who challenge my thinking.\n\nWhat Rep. Maxine Waters did, in calling for the harassment of Trump administration officials, was completely unacceptable. Had she been a Republican, she would have been shamed into resignation.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to like or agree with one another. But wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could get back to the art of agreeing to disagree? Heck, if we have an open conversation, maybe we could all learn a thing or two.\n\nThose are my Final Thoughts. From LA, God Bless and take care."

They may not have certificates or wear special vests that give them upgraded seating status on airplanes, but they greatly enhance our lives in a number of ways.\n\nNumerous studies have shown evidence that pets not only provide companionship and bring joy, they can also help people recover or better cope with a wide range of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and mental health disorders.\n\nAnd when a pet dies, it can be an emotionally devastating experience that can have a negative impact on our both our mental and physical health.\n\nIn fact, the New England Journal of Medicine reports one 61-year-old woman began experiencing severe chest pains following the death of her dog. She was admitted to the ER where doctors diagnosed her with takotsubo cardiomyopathy \u2014 otherwise known as \u201cbroken-heart syndrome\u201d \u2014 a condition with symptoms that mimic a heart attack.\n\nAfter being treated with medications she eventually recovered, but the death of her Yorkshire terrier literally broke her heart.\n\nThe loss of a cherished pet can be every bit as difficult as losing a person \u2014 or in some cases, even worse.\n\nResearchers have found that social support is essential for recovery during the grieving process. However, while others are typically quick to help comfort an individual who is grieving the loss of another person, society\u2019s attitude toward pet loss is very different.\n\nPeople are often denied sufficient support following the death of a pet, which can increase emotional distress and lead to feelings of shame and isolation.\n\nThis can be particularly difficult for children who are experiencing the loss of a pet for the first time.\n\nPet loss can be especially hard for kids\n\nLeah Carson, now a young adult, remembers her first pet. It was a gentle Golden Retriever mix named Sandy.\n\n\u201cWe grew up together and she did everything with our family. I remember playing in the snow, hiking, and [sweet moments like] Sandy following me to my room when I came home from school,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWhen I was about 11-years old, Sandy got cancer and we had to put her to sleep. I cried a ton. I was so sad and confused. It was the first time I\u2019d ever lost someone I loved. Afterward, there was so much quiet in her absence.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s memories of Sandy are both heartwarming and heartbreaking, especially for those who\u2019ve personally experienced similar loss at a young age.\n\nRoxanne Hawn, author of \u201cHeart Dog: Surviving the Loss of Your Canine Soul Mate,\u201d understands that children are especially vulnerable to misunderstanding and grief following the death of a pet. She points out there are a variety of ways parents and adults can help kids through the grieving process.\n\n\u201cI suggest taking on memorial projects to focus your grief, and your kids\u2019 grief, in productive ways,\u201d Hawn says. \u201cIt\u2019s better to embrace grief through action rather than ignore it.\"\n\nHawn says grieving as a family can help children better process the loss, and she suggests activities in which each family member can participate as they feel the need.\n\n\u201cHave everyone write down as many happy memories as they can on colorful scraps of paper, and place all those good thoughts into a pretty bowl,\u201d she says, offering one example. \u201cAnytime someone experiences a surge in grief, they can grab one of those slips of paper and, at least for a moment, remember a happier time. Children who can\u2019t yet write or spell can contribute drawings of their pet instead.\u201d\n\nHawn also suggests allowing children to keep a pet\u2019s beloved memento with them such as a collar or favorite toy \u2014 especially during the days immediately following the loss \u2014 its presence can help.\n\nAge doesn\u2019t make it easier\n\nWith a lifetime of experiences, senior citizens might seem as if they\u2019d be better equipped to deal with the loss of a pet, but the opposite is often true.\n\n\u201cLosing a pet is extremely difficult for seniors. It is more than normal grief,\u201d Lisa Frankel, PhD, a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist tells Healthline. \u201cSeniors have already dealt with so much loss: friends, family, life structure, hope, physical contact, community.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cPets, especially dogs, give them purpose, companionship, a reason to exercise and socialize. When a dog dies, all of that is gone.\u201d\n\nIn Frankel\u2019s practice, she works with many patients who are experiencing deep grief from the loss of a pet. She points out how feelings of guilt and shame can often complicate the grieving process. She cites examples of people who have lost their pet to coyote attacks or being hit by a car say they feel they could have done more to save their pet. Also, she points out others who have made the difficult decision to euthanize their pet are haunted by their decision.\n\nShe urges people who have lost a pet in these circumstances to be compassionate and forgive themselves, as well as spend time with others who understand their feelings. She also suggests organizations such as pet grief support groups, which can be a great comfort for some.\n\n\u201cIndividual therapy can be helpful as well,\u201d Frankel says. \u201cMany people have a hard time opening up in groups and do better with individual counseling. If therapy triggers other losses or traumas, these losses might also have to be looked at. Grief that is really debilitating or lasts exceptionally long might be complicated by the association of the loss to other losses and trauma. Individual therapy might be really important to understand this connection and to work it through.\u201d\n\nHow to cope\n\nWhile no one approach to coping will work for all people who have lost a pet, there are many options and resources available to help.\n\nIn addition to the suggestions Frankel offered, she also recommends two books, \u201cHow to ROAR: Pet Loss Grief Recovery\u201d by Robin Jean Brown and \u201cThe Loss of a Pet: A Guide to Coping with the Grieving Process When a Pet Dies\u201d by Wallace Sife, founder of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement.\n\nThe blog Pet Loss Help has published an expansive list of bereavement resources which includes numerous pet-loss support hotlines and information about support groups in different states, as well as additional online resources.\n\nShould you adopt another pet?\n\nThere will never be another pet quite like the one you lost, and the thought of adopting another might seem disloyal, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nPets enrich our lives and we, in turn, enrich theirs.\n\nThere\u2019s much to gain by allowing yourself to love again and pet owners have so much love to give.\n\nAdopting a new pet could be just what the doctor ordered to help mend a broken heart.\n\nThis article first appeared on HealthLine.com."

			"text": "It\u2019s a four-letter phenomenon that Americans can\u2019t imagine life without. But when HGTV debuted nearly 25 years ago, the idea of turning on the TV and being entertained by a bathroom renovation was ludicrous. Today, however, TV execs see home and garden improvement shows like \"Property Brothers,\" \"Fixer Upper,\" and \"Love It or List It\" as lucrative.\n\nUnfortunately, their popularity comes at the expense of real estate professionals. Unlike viewers, these critics know firsthand that what makes for good reality TV can make for bad reality out in the real world.\n\nHere are nine reasons the experts want you to turn off HGTV \u2014 now.\n\nKnocking down walls isn\u2019t that easy\n\nSoap operas have kissing scenes and action movies have car chases. On HGTV, there\u2019s usually always a scene where a wall or two get knocked down. That\u2019s OK on shows like \"Good Bones,\" but in real life, walls are often the last thing you want to touch.\n\n\u201cWhen someone buys a '90s-era home which was built quickly and on the cheap, we can\u2019t rip out walls,\" says Teris Pantazes, a licensed contractor in Baltimore, and manager of EFynch. \u201cIt\u2019s important for a home to have good bones. I have been in this business for a long time but I\u2019m not an engineer. I still have customers question me and I see them waste tons of money to verify what I already told them.\u201d\n\nTransactions, and transformations, take a LOT of time\n\n\"The No. 1 problem with real estate television shows is that they significantly shorten the amount of time that almost anything takes, for the purposes of advancing the narrative,\u201d explains Kevin Deselms. The Hollywood film-editor-turned-Colorado-Realtor\u00ae, says this gives his clients unreasonable expectations for timelines. For example, on \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d \u2014 which has been publicly called out for misleading viewers \u2014 prospective buyers only view three houses. That, and a lot of editing, is how home purchases happen in less than 30 minutes. (TLC\u2019s hit show \u201cTrading Spaces\u201d practically invented the 48-hour room transformation, but the show also caught a lot of flak for leaving homeowners with things like shoddy work, wet paint and unfinished flooring.)\n\nNegotiations don\u2019t typically go down in coffee shops\n\n\"I wish clients would stop watching HGTV so I can stop explaining that negotiations occur over a couple of days through emails, not on the phone in a coffee shop,\" says Evan Roberts, a real estate agent and founder of Dependable Homebuyers. The typical televised scenario that takes a matter of seconds (there\u2019s no such thing as phone tag on TV) is very misleading, he says. \"Buyers should expect that the sellers are busy living their lives as well.\"\n\nObtaining permits requires way more patience\n\nJeffrey A. Hensel at North Coast Financial, Inc. has been providing \u201cfix and flip loans\u201d to real estate investors looking for quick profits. For years, he\u2019s had to preach the virtue of patience to these same clients. \u201cHGTV shows sometimes discuss the need for permits, but they don\u2019t often show how this process can slow down the entire project,\u201d says Hensel. According to him, waiting for approval to move forward can easily increase the remodel time (and the budget) by 50 percent.\n\nProducers create unnecessary drama\n\nDo most shoppers wear GoPros when looking for window treatments or measuring hardware for their cabinets? No. That\u2019s probably because they know friends, family and even themselves, would fall asleep watching those videos.\n\n\"Clients who are HGTV fans typically expect the same excitement, surprises and flair that they see on TV,\" says Sacha Ferrandi. But according to the CEO of Source Capital Funding, Inc., which finances a lot of home renovations, it's important for professionals to ease clients\u2019 minds \u2014 and limit all that the drama \u2014 for the sake of both parties. In real life, where you have to work on top of managing your home renovation or house hunt, the less stress, the better.\n\nReal estate can ruin relationships\n\nWhether they\u2019re the homeowners or the show\u2019s hosts, happy spouses are everywhere on HGTV. That\u2019s why it was such a shock last year when \u201cFlip or Flop\u2019s\u201d hosts, Tarek and Christina El Moussa, announced their split. But to Sissy Lappin, founder of ListingDoor, it came as no surprise.\n\n\u201cThe fastest way to end up divorced other than having an affair is to renovate,\u201d swears Lappin. \u201cYou will not be smiling like Chip and Joanna, drinking lemonade with chocolate chip cookies. You will be pulling each other\u2019s hair out like the 'Real Housewives of New Jersey.\u2019\u201d\n\nSellers don\u2019t care about your renovation budget.They care about the comps in the neighborhood.\n\n\"The worst precedent set by HGTV is in their show 'Property Brothers,' where the agent frequently tells buyers that they should make an offer significantly below list price to account for their desired renovation budget,\u201d says Jeff Miller, a Maryland-based real estate agent with AE Home Group. \u201cThe truth is, the only thing that matters is what other homes in the neighborhood have sold for.\u201d\n\nHGTV worships false budgets\n\nMost viewers already know this, and several articles including this Twitter rant recap have been written about it. After all, it doesn\u2019t take a math genius to figure out that most Americans don\u2019t have $1 million laying around for a second home, and the kind of kitchen a $5,000 renovation gets you won\u2019t include granite countertops and a smart fridge that sends its inventory to your phone. For more practical numbers, Gwyn Donohue, Executive Director of the National Association of Home Builders, recommends watching \u201cToday\u2019s Homewowner with Danny Lipford.\u201d\n\nBigger renovations don\u2019t always equal bigger ROIs\n\n\"HGTV shows like to feature flips with full kitchen and bath remodels because the before-and-after shots make for more compelling viewing,\u201d says Bobby Montagne, CEO of Walnut Street Finance, who also counts himself a fan of \u201cThis Old House\u201d because it\u2019s more slowly-paced. \u201cIn fact, aspiring fix-and-flippers are often better off doing small-scale renovations that just need carpet, paint and some freshening up, especially for their first projects.\u201d Montagne says smaller budgets, less room for error, and less time on the job often equal the ROI winning combination."

			"text": "Basketball star LeBron James has agreed to a four-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, his agency said Sunday evening.\n\nKlutch Sports Group announced that the contract would pay James a fully guaranteed $154 million. ESPN reported that the fourth year of the deal was a player option that James can decline in order to become a free agent again after the 2020-21 season.\n\nThis is the third time in eight years that James has changed teams via free agency. He left the Cleveland Cavaliers following the 2010 season to go to the Miami Heat. He returned to Cleveland following the 2014 season.\n\nThe 33-year-old James, one of the greatest players in the NBA, is coming off a season in which he reached his eighth straight championship series. He is the first player to do so in half a century.\n\nLast season, his 15th as a professional, James averaged 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists per game while playing in all 82 regular season games. In the playoffs, James was even better, averaging 34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists per game as the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals before being swept by the Golden State Warriors.\n\nDuring his second stint with the team that drafted him in 2003, James led the Cavaliers to the Finals in all four seasons. His team lost three of their four matchups against the Warriors, but their seven-game victory in 2016 brought the city of Cleveland its first professional sports championship since 1964.\n\nIn going to the Lakers, James is the latest in a long line of superstars -- from Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Shaquille O'Neal -- who have arrived in Los Angeles with a mandate to win championships. The Lakers have won 16 NBA titles in their illustrious history, but have not made the playoffs since 2013.\n\nLos Angeles will also provide James with a larger platform for his business interests and social activism. He already owns two homes in Southern California and has a film production company.\n\nThe simple statement released by Klutch Sports is a stark contrast to how James has handled his previous moves. In 2010, he announced he was going to the Miami Heat at the conclusion of an ESPN special. In 2014, James announced he was returning to the Cavaliers via an as-told-to article in Sports Illustrated.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

And then from day of nomination to a vote in the Senator it usually takes about 70-100 days. (00:40)\n\nOn confirming Justice in an election year: Well, it's a different kind of election year. You know, the constitution gives the president the appointing authority and so when there's a presidential election and there's a Supreme Court vacancy really close to it there are good reasons for letting the American people elect a president and having a Supreme Court Justice selected later. This is a little different since this is the Senate re-elect. (1:14)\n\nOn how much they think about Senate when considering a nominee: Well, you have to remember that after the President was selected everybody came off of a very very ugly contentious political period and so even at the very start of the President's first selection process it was important to consider what kinds of people could get through the Senate and still be consistent with the President's philosophical principles on these issues. (3:05)\n\nOn issues Court is facing: First, I think you've seen the First Amendment get increased attention and emphasis. Freedom of speech in particular you saw three big cases this term regarding that. You see a little bit more in the area of free exercise of religion, less on the establishment cause and the establishment of religion more on free exercise, which again is kind of a freedom of expression area. So a lot on that area. (4:59)\n\nOn Court's importance recently on key issues: I can tell you the Court doesn't want to play that role. The Court wants the political branches to do what they're supposed to do and the Court wants to do basically what it's supposed to do. (6:38)\n\nWatch below:"

And while \u201cmost adults surveyed (in Western Europe) still do consider themselves Christians,\u201d the vast majority of them don\u2019t attend church services.\n\n\u201cIn the United Kingdom, for example, there are roughly three times as many non-practicing Christians (55%) as there are church-attending Christians (18%).\u201d\n\nDespite this trend in Europe, Christian symbols are increasingly seen in many countries. A recent article described this phenomenon, citing an order \u201cto hang a cross in the entrance of every state building in Bavaria.\u201d\n\nReligious symbols \u201care making a powerful comeback\u201d in Germany as well, even though Christianity is in decline. One official \u201cinsisted that the \u2018cross is not a sign of religion\u2019 but of identity and culture.\u201d\n\nWhy do so many Europeans still \u201cconsider themselves Christians, even if they seldom go to church?\u201d\n\nIn some countries (like Germany), it may simply be a reaction to the fact Europe has \u201copened its doors to more than a million migrants, many from predominantly Muslim countries.\u201d\n\nBut something else may also be responsible for our hesitancy to jettison religion altogether, both in Europe and America. We may just be innately religious.\n\nEven those Americans who have abandoned Christian churches, for example, find themselves searching for an adequate replacement.\n\n\u201cAtheist churches,\u201d have been formed across the country, aiming to \u201coffer some features of a religious congregation (fellowship, collective enjoyment, a stimulus to moral behavior).\u201d These congregations meet on Sundays and some \u201cinclude \u2018Sunday School\u2019, where children go while parents attend \u2018services.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen asked if these \u201catheist churches\u201d could be described as a form of religion, the founder of the Seattle Atheist Church responded with a \u201cdefinite \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt appears that Americans, particularly millennial Americans, \u201care not abandoning organized religion to become secular, science-loving humanists.\u201d Instead, many millennials who have rejected Christianity still \u201cbelieve in the soul, divine energy, (and) mystical realities.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a recent American Pew Research Center study found that of those who claim no religious affiliation, 17 percent still said they believed in the God as described in the Bible, and 53 percent said they believed in a higher power or spiritual force.\n\nEven 18 percent of self-proclaimed atheists said they believed in some kind of higher spiritual power. Pew continues to find that religiously non-affiliated Americans \u201care as religious as \u2013 or even more religious than \u2013 Christians in several European countries, including France, Germany, and the U.K.\u201d\n\nSo, while we Americans may report that we\u2019re less likely to identify ourselves with Christianity, we haven\u2019t yet rejected many core supernatural beliefs common to the faith, nor have we resisted our predisposition to form communities that resemble traditional congregations. Try as we might, it won\u2019t be easy to abandon our religious identity."

The second Ford-Class carrier, the USS Kennedy, is more than 80-percent built and the third Ford-class carrier will be called the USS Enterprise.\n\nThe USS Kennedy will replace the USS Nimitz which is due to retire by 2027; the Ford-class carriers are slated to replace the existing Nimitz-class carriers on a one-to-one basis in an incremental fashion over the next 50 or more years.\n\nAs a result, the Navy is making a specific effort to expedite the acquisition of its Ford-class carrier by exploring the possibility of buying the third and fourth Ford-class carriers at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe Navy released a CVN 80/81 two-ship buy Request for Proposal to Huntington Ingalls Industries - to further define the cost savings achievable with a potential two-ship buy. The Navy received HII response May 1 and will consider it in its procurement planning for both ships,\u201d Couch said.\n\nStreamlining acquisition of the Ford-class also naturally brings the advantage of potentially speeding up construction and delivery of the new ships as well, something of significance to the Navy\u2019s fast-tracked effort to reach a 355-ship fleet.\n\nPart of this strategy is articulated in the Navy\u2019s recent 2019 30-year shipbuilding plan, called the \u201cReport to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels for Fiscal Year 2019.\u201d\n\nThe plan says the Navy is working on \u201csetting the conditions for an enduring industrial base as the top priority, so that the Navy is postured to respond to more aggressive investment in any year.\u201d\n\nEfforts to control carrier costs has been a long-standing challenge for the Navy. Several years ago, the Navy received substantial criticism from lawmakers and government watchdog groups during the construction of the USS Ford for rising costs. Construction costs for the USS Ford wound up being several billion above early cost estimates. Cost overruns with the construction wound up leading Congress to impose a $12.9 billion cost-cap on the ship.\n\nAt the time, Navy officials pointed out that integrating new technologies brings challenges and that at least $3 billion of the Ford\u2019s costs were due to what\u2019s described as non-recurring engineering costs for a first-in-class ship such as this.\n\nFor instance, Ford-class carriers are built with a larger flight deck able to increase the sortie-generation rate by 33-percent, an electromagnetic catapult to replace the current steam system and much greater levels of automation or computer controls throughout the ship. The ship is also engineered to accommodate new sensors, software, weapons and combat systems as they emerge, Navy officials have said.\n\nThe USS Ford is built with four 26-megawatt generators, bringing a total of 104 megawatts to the ship. This helps support the ship's developing systems such as its Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System, or EMALS, and provides power for future systems such as lasers and rail-guns, many Navy senior leaders have explained.\n\nHII ship developers have been making an aggressive effort to lower costs of the USS Kennedy. Officials have said that the cost of the USS Kennedy will be well over $1.5 billion less than the costs to build the first Ford-Class ship.\n\nOne of the construction techniques for Kennedy construction has included efforts to assemble compartments and parts of the ship together before moving them to the dock \u2013 this expedites construction by allowing builders to integrate larger parts of the ship more quickly.\n\nThis technique, referred to by Huntington Ingalls developers as \u201cmodular construction,\u201d was also used when building the Ford; the process welds smaller sections of the ship together into larger structural \u201csuperlift\u201d units before being lifted into the dry dock, HII statements explained.\n\nConstruction begins with the bottom of the ship and works up with inner-bottoms and side shells before moving to box units, he explained. The bottom third of the ship gets built first. Also, some of the design methods now used for the Kennedy include efforts to fabricate or forge some parts of the ship - instead of casting them because it makes the process less expensive, builders explained.\n\nAlso, Newport News Shipbuilding \u2013 a division of HII - was able to buy larger quantities of parts earlier in the construction process with the Kennedy because, unlike the circumstance during the building of the USS Ford, the Kennedy\u2019s ship design was complete before construction begins.\n\nAs for the design, the Kennedy will be largely similar to the design of the USS Ford, with a few minor alterations. The Kennedy will receive a new radar and its aircraft elevators will use electric motors instead of a hydraulic system to lower costs.\n\nMore Weapons and Technology - WARRIOR MAVEN (CLICK HERE)"

			"text": "Fewer people are celebrating Father\u2019s Day than ever before, a fact that may have less to do with the nature of the holiday than it does with the nature of American families.\n\nA U.S. Census Bureau study found that the percentage of children living in single-parent households increased from 12 percent in 1960 to 31 percent in 2016. During that same timeframe, \u201cthe percentage of children living with only their mother nearly tripled.\u201d\n\nThese numbers are sobering because according to recent studies, kids who lack an engaged father (and so may be less likely to observe Father\u2019s Day) are also less likely to experience a healthy, contented, and successful life.\n\nI had only celebrated a handful of Father\u2019s Days with my kids when I first recognized this truth. I was assigned to our police department\u2019s Gang Detail at the time, investigating young gang members in Los Angeles County.\n\nOur city was culturally and ethnically diverse, but we had a gang problem that seemed to transcend ethnic, cultural, or socio-economic boundaries. The gang members we encountered were racially and ethnically diverse, representing local white, Hispanic, African-American and Asian-American gangs. They came from a variety of economic settings, from very wealthy neighborhoods to impoverished segments of our community.\n\nAs a young father myself, I wanted to understand what caused the young men and women in our community to become gang members in the first place. It certainly didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with their race, culture or economic status, given the fact that they didn\u2019t share any of these attributes.\n\nThe more I got to know these young gang members, the better I understood their common dilemma: all of them suffered from \u201clack of dad.\u201d\n\nThis \u201clack of dad\u201d looked different for each gang member, depending on his or her situation. Some gang members had fathers who were uninvolved, alcoholic or \u201cdeadbeat\u201d dads. Some never knew their fathers and were raised in single-parent households by their mothers or grandmothers.\n\nSome were part of multigenerational gang families with fathers who had been incarcerated for most of their lives. Some simply had dads who worked obsessively and paid them little attention.\n\nI repeatedly observed the same shared attributes in these gang members: They were struggling to find direction or establish a moral compass, largely because they didn\u2019t have a father at home to model what it meant to be a man \u2013 or to be loved by one.\n\nMany national studies have confirmed my own anecdotal observations. Fathers are essential to boys and girls.\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that children who are raised with involved fathers are less likely to struggle academically, repeat a grade, get expelled or suspended from school, and get pregnant as teenage girls.\n\nChildren with involved fathers are more likely to attend college, get a good job and stay out of jail.\n\nStudies also show that kids raised without involved fathers are more likely to live in poverty, be abused or neglected, use drugs or alcohol and commit crimes.\n\nKids aren\u2019t the only who benefit from engaged dads. Fatherhood also benefits fathers.\n\nResearchers have recently discovered that fathers who are engaged with their kids are less likely to suffer from stress and depression and are more likely to have increased self-esteem, job and relationship satisfaction, and confidence in their parenting skills.\n\nFatherhood increases one\u2019s competence in a number of important areas of character development, including the formation of patience, humility and selflessness.\n\nMy days as a Gang Detail officer taught me that every version of \u201clack of dad\u201d is equally damaging; none is better (or worse) than any other.\n\nMy days as a father taught me much more about myself, my priorities and my role in the lives of my kids.\n\nSo, this year, as Americans spend far less time, energy and money celebrating Father\u2019s Day than they do celebrating Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019m determined to develop a renewed enthusiasm for the holiday and a renewed appreciation for the role of fathers."

But prosecutors said Lochte invented the story to cover up the swimmers' vandalism of a gas station and an ensuing confrontation with security guards. The confrontation was captured by surveillance cameras at the gas station.\n\nLochte later acknowledged he was intoxicated at the time and his behavior led to the confrontation.\n\nThe initial claim appeared to confirm widespread fears before the Olympics that the event would be marred by rising crime rates in Rio de Janeiro, which has long struggled with violence. As Lochte's version of events began to shift, many Brazilians became annoyed that a false story about crime drew so much attention, when the city had hosted the games without major problems.\n\nThe scandal drew international headlines and grew to overshadow the final days of the games. Lochte ended up serving a 10-month suspension from the U.S. national swim team for his behavior.\n\nLast year, a court dismissed the case against Lochte, but the Superior Court of Justice reversed that decision Tuesday. Prosecutor Rodrigo de Almeida Maia said Thursday that the next step is for Lochte's lawyers to present their defense. Lochte does not have to appear in person to defend himself, de Almeida Maia said.\n\nSteve Lochte, the swimmer's father, said by telephone that he had no comment and directed questions to his son or his son's lawyers.\n\nJeff Ostrow, a lawyer who has represented Lochte in the past, did not immediately respond to an email and a voicemail message seeking comment. It was not clear if he would represent Lochte in this case."

She was later sent to a state facility in Frisco Creek.\n\n\u201cWhen the bear was brought in, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was going to make it,\u201d Michael Sirochman, manager of the Frisco Creek facility, said in a statement.\n\nHowever, the cub is now \u201cresponding very well to treatment,\u201d he said, adding that she will likely be returned to the wild this winter.\n\nSirochman said the cub's burns were severe. She's being treated with salve, bandages, antibiotics and pain medication, and is eating solid food and a liquid milk replacement.\n\nOnce she heals, she will spend the rest of her days at the facility with four other bear cubs who are also expected to be released this winter.\n\n\"We have good luck returning young bears to the wild,\" Sirochman said, adding that the CPW is \u201cvery strict about minimizing human contact.\u201d Excess interaction with humans could make it difficult for the cub to survive in the wild, the agency said.\n\nThe wildfire that injured the cub has burned 65 square miles near Durango in the southwestern corner of the state. More than 2,000 homes were evacuated at one point, but those residents were allowed to return. Additionally, five other Colorado wildfires prompted the evacuation of at least 650 homes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

			"text": "Look outside your window and you will probably see dinosaurs. They are flying, hopping, chirping and perching on trees. You call them birds, but they are dinosaurs.\n\nThey are not descended from dinosaurs. They are dinosaurs.\n\nBiologically, they are the flying equivalent of the velociraptors that scared you in \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d\n\nThey share the same highly efficient lungs, the same skeletal system, the same highly intelligent brain and the same effective eyesight.\n\nI was reminded of the marvelous wonders of the natural world and the fascinating evolution of science by a very readable new book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World,\u201d by Steve Brusatte.\n\nBrusatte, a 34-year old Illinois native and paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, has the personality of a natural entertainer. His stories of dinosaurs and the people who love them bring paleontology to life. He knows how to entertain and educate so that science comes alive and you become engrossed in the stories of how knowledge expands and refines.\n\nDinosaurs are a wonderful example of how knowledge changes over time and how scientific conclusions must adjust to new facts and new understanding.\n\nWhen I was young, dinosaurs were analyzed as though they were cold-blooded reptiles. Cold blood limits the amount of oxygen you can process. You can have a burst of speed, but then you must rest and recuperate.\n\nBecause of this belief in the reptile-like dinosaurs, they were portrayed in energy-saving postures. The Tyrannosaurus rex was depicted as upright but with its tail dragging on the ground. Furthermore, since we thought they were reptile-like and cold-blooded, we believed they could not be related to birds.\n\nDr. John Ostrom, a paleontologist at Yale University, began proposing that birds were dinosaurs in the 1970s \u2013 resurrecting a theory that Thomas Henry Huxley had first proposed in the 1860s. For a century, the scientific establishment had rejected Huxley and insisted that dinosaurs were reptiles, like lizards.\n\nDr. Ostrom and his charismatic, almost rabble rousing student, Bob Bakker, popularized Ostrom\u2019s theories in a terrific book, \u201cThe Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and Their Extinction.\u201d\n\nAt the time, what Ostrom was saying was seen as heresy by most of the older paleontologists. Yet, the nature of science is such that facts matter. The case for warm-blooded birds being dinosaurs became so strong that, by inference, the dinosaurs were warm-blooded. If they were warm-blooded, the museum exhibits had to be changed to represent a much more active and more dynamic animal. Suddenly T-Rex was even more formidable and more frightening.\n\nBrusatte outlines the evolution of our knowledge as new discoveries piled up on the side of the warm-blooded birds are dinosaurs thesis.\n\nThen came the great discoveries of actual feathers on dinosaurs in China. Now, the linkages have become irrefutable.\n\nEarly feathers were very simple and apparently grown for warmth or for signaling. The prettier the feathers, the more likely the dinosaur was to attract a mate (patterns which certainly exist in birds today).\n\nGradually, some dinosaurs began growing more complex feathers and began to learn how to fly. Then their body shape changed and included lighter bones, less weight, and very strong chest muscles to power the wings.\n\nSuddenly, you have flying dinosaurs, which we now call birds.\n\nOne of Brusatte\u2019s most interesting sections is on the lung systems that dinosaurs developed, which are so different from and much more powerful than mammal lung systems. Dinosaurs, like us, get oxygen out of incoming air that is inhaled, but they also have a system of air sacs that captures and momentarily stores some of the incoming air.\n\nWhen we exhale we send out carbon dioxide but get no new oxygen until we inhale again. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, get a second wave of oxygen to absorb when they release the stored fresh air from their air sacs.\n\nEssentially, they get two breaths of air each time they inhale. As the need for more air sacs grew, they infiltrated into bone structures. Classic dinosaur skeletons show the air sacs in bones, just like modern birds.\n\nThis double-breath lung technique allows dinosaurs to have much more oxygen than mammals and gives them additional energy. It is a major factor in modern birds being able to fly at very high altitudes.\n\nI strongly urge you to read \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs.\u201d It will both entertain and educate you.\n\nIn addition, I urge you to look around at the wonders of the natural world and take some time this summer to reflect on the amazing complexity of the world in which we live.\n\nFinally, I think you will have a renewed respect for the process of science and a renewed caution in believing that current \u201cscientific consensus\u201d is unchanging and unchallengeable.\n\nIf you have some young relatives or friends, give them a copy of Brusatte\u2019s book. You might be launching new paleontologists as they find themselves absorbed by his book and his personality."

TMZ reports that the couple took their two daughters to the theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., and they say what started out as a fun outing turned into a serious injury.\n\nDollywood's website calls the attraction \"Tennessee's first and only water coaster,\" saying it \"races through the trees four stories in the air as you experience four drops along 1,175 feet of track.\"\n\nIn court documents obtained by TMZ, the couple claim they followed Dollywood Splash Country staff instructions while boarding the water ride, but as the raft reached the apex of its ascent, the wife was \"propelled off the seat and she then fell down into the raft striking her spine on the hard surface.\" According to the filing, she heard something pop, followed by a burning sensation. She claims she had no feeling in her legs and was unable to move them at the end of the ride, and the suit claims she suffered a compression fracture and other spinal injuries.\n\nThe couple are asking for more than $2 million, claiming the park was negligent and failed to properly warn patrons about the dangers of the ride.\n\nAnother couple, Tedi and Derryl Brown, sued Dollywood in 2014, claiming the wife suffered a permanent brain injury after falling from a ride called the Waltzing Swinger. Dollywood responded to that complaint by claiming Brown jumped off the ride before it stopped, and the parties later agreed to mediation.\n\nTaste of Country reached out to Dollywood for comment on TMZ's report. In a written reply, a spokesperson states, \"We are aware of the allegations listed in the suit but do not comment on pending litigation.\""

As we approach the Fourth of July and celebrate the greatness of America, I\u2019ve been specifically thinking of him in the context of disturbing stories in the news and how political disagreements between Americans have escalated into personal demonization and even hatred for ideological opponents.\n\nRecent examples of this include: White House press secretary Sarah Sanders being asked to leave a restaurant; Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen being harassed at another restaurant and outside her home; and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi being forced out of a movie theater by protesters who surrounded her and shouted at her.\n\nAnother example is the call just a few days ago by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., for Americans to harass Trump administration officials. She told a group of people that \u201cif you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd a far more serious example was the gunman who was so upset at President Trump\u2019s election that he opened fire on Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice a year ago. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., was seriously wounded and nearly died.\n\nPresident Reagan \u2013 who was badly wounded in an assassination attempt in 1981 that was not politically motivated \u2013 never engaged in the politics of personal demonization. He set the standard for respect that we would be wise to emulate still.\n\nPresident Reagan \u2013 who was badly wounded in an assassination attempt in 1981 that was not politically motivated \u2013 never engaged in the politics of personal demonization. He set the standard for respect that we would be wise to emulate still.\n\nAs a young person, I believed (as many people do when entering the professional arena) that I would have to choose one of two paths \u2013 either be strong and successful, or be a person of good character and civility. And then I met President Reagan, who was the embodiment of both.\n\nPresident Reagan was a person of unquestioned strength (he went toe to toe with the Soviet Union) and yet a gentleman personally and a politician who could work across the political aisle. He completely shattered my theory of having to choose \u2013 and he now, sadly, represents an era nearly gone by. America is facing the tragic and dire consequences of that loss.\n\nIn a nation that claims to stand for tolerance, inclusion and openness \u2013 and prides itself on being welcoming and accepting of people from all backgrounds, lifestyles and personal differences \u2013 that acceptance now seems to have drawn a red line in the sand of ideological tolerance.\n\nOn one side of that line are all the people who are demanding they be accepted for who and what they are or are advocating for the rights of others to be recipients of that respect and acceptance. On the other side of that line is anyone who disagrees with them \u2013 or who they even think disagrees with them for any reason, large or small.\n\nThe very people who say \u201cthat\u2019s not who we are as a nation\u201d with regard to immigration or discrimination should ask themselves why that same statement doesn\u2019t appear to apply to all of their fellow Americans.\n\nCan we disagree without being disagreeable? Can we demand acceptance and tolerance for ourselves and justify not giving it in return? Are we so afraid of dissenting ideas that we need to suppress them? And silence them? Is that who we are? Is that who we have become now?\n\nI refuse to accept that premise and hope the voices of intolerance will realize the very rationale they use for justifying their hatred is the very right they themselves demand. They represent the hypocrisy of one-sided hate.\n\nWhen we allow hate against anyone for any reason, that slippery slope of intolerance often winds up eventually undercutting our own footing.\n\nThose who throw hatred toward others and wish to take away the right to have a differing opinion should be cautioned: they could find themselves on the opposite side of that red line of tolerance if the court of public opinion suddenly decides they are the enemy, or if they aren\u2019t aligned with the groupthink of the moment.\n\nAs Americans we have always been on the forefront of big ideas, dreams, innovation and creativity. I believe we still have room for all of that \u2013 and don\u2019t have to choose to be right or win to the exclusion of civility. That\u2019s not who we are as a nation.\n\nI hope the events of the past few days make us all take another look in the mirror and decide anew what we want that reflection to be. I hope we choose again to follow Ronald Reagan\u2019s example and reflect the best of us \u2013 not the worst of us.\n\nThe political climate is not only hostile, it\u2019s now bordering on dangerous. Can we return to a time of civility where we talk to people, not about them? We should embrace the essence of President Reagan and remember when he said: \u201cWhatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears; to your confidence rather than your doubts.\u201d\n\nAs a nation let\u2019s step away from the dangerous brink of fear and doubt and hatred for each other. Let\u2019s return to being hopeful and confident in the best of ourselves individually and collectively. That is who we are. And should be still.\n\nWhat better way to rededicate ourselves to the American ideals that should unify us and that we celebrate on the Fourth of July?"

I grew up with a dad who preferred to spend more time with a bottle in his hand than with us.\n\nWhen you grow up with an absent, alcoholic father, it\u2019s very easy to follow the same path of destruction. Though I did start that way, I was fortunate not to become another statistic. Many young men aren\u2019t as lucky.\n\nIn fact, every year more and more boys grow up fatherless or without a positive male figure in their lives. You might be thinking that\u2019s sad, but it has nothing to do with you.\n\nWrong.\n\nAs a men\u2019s pastor and former mental health professional, I see the impact fatherlessness has on our society. Today, virtually every social evil, injustice or abnormality can be traced to absent, delinquent, misbehaving, drunk, or sexually immoral dads who didn\u2019t respect or understand their enormous calling.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Turn on the news. There are plenty of recent events highlighting the epidemic of young men wreaking havoc. Look at the school shootings that have taken place over the past year. All of the suspects are male and many of them grew up fatherless.\n\nThis should come as no surprise because research from the National Center for Fathering suggests that fatherless children are nine times more likely to drop out of school, 11 times more likely to exhibit violent behavior and 20 times more likely to be incarcerated.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nIf you are a dad, it\u2019s time to evaluate your relationships with your children. Are they a priority to you? If not, I encourage you to change that. Maybe that means fewer hours at the office, or the bar, or setting aside a few hours on the weekend to do a project with your son.\n\nIf you grew up with a positive male figure, whether it was your own dad or someone else, consider becoming a mentor to a boy who is fatherless.\n\nBoys are looking for someone to show them the way. If young men don\u2019t get healthy approval from a father or father figure, they will chase it in a number of unhealthy and self-destructive ways that destroy them and the people around them.\n\nMen become men in the company of other men. That\u2019s a sociological fact all over the globe, in every culture. Whatever is modeled, mentored or messaged is always multiplied with respect to boys, young men and fathers.\n\nDads, the boys in your life are watching, waiting and learning.

The right ones could increase a home's value by 10 percent over comparable listings, and one extra-special amenity is worth a 97 percent premium, according to a recent Realtor.com\u00ae report.\n\nThose trying to get the biggest return on their investment should have an outdoor shower installed ASAP.\n\nSome may debate whether these are the most awesome, get-back-to-nature inventions ever \u2014 or the worst. In any case, homes with the outside bathing areas saw a 97-percent price-per-square-foot premium, according to our research. (To come up with our findings, we scoured our listings for summer-related, outdoor features in single-family homes on the market for $150,000 and above.)\n\n\"Outdoor features can give a home a special quality in the market,\" says Javier Vivas, Realtor.com's director of economic research. \"And anytime you have a unique feature, it can bolster the prospective value of a home.\"\n\nOutdoor showers are likely appealing to buyers, because the homes that have them are more likely to be on the water (the showers are great to wash off the sand from the beach before stepping inside) or attached to more expensive properties with other luxe amenities.\n\nAnd in some parts of the country, outdoor showers are worth more than others. In New York state, homes with them are listed for 256 percent more per square foot than other residences for sale in the state.\n\nOutdoor showers weren't the only features that contributed to a home's potential value.\n\nNothing says summer like throwing some burgers and ears of corn on the grill, so it makes sense that homes with barbecue stations are 26 percent pricier than those without.\n\nBarbecues are mentioned in nearly 10 percent of all listings on Realtor.com and are most popular in Arizona and California. But the biggest payoff is in Utah, where homes that mention barbecues are listed for 58 percent more per square foot compared with other homes in the state.\n\nPools with enough space around them for friends and family to lounge about also gave home prices a 26 percent lift. But these so-called entertainer's pools gave New York state homes the biggest increase \u2014 at a whopping 224 percent more per square foot. This basically tripled the price of these homes for sale.\n\nMeanwhile, fire pits gave residences a 25 percent premium. Why not? There are few things more satisfying than sitting in front of crackling flames, roasting marshmallows. The outdoor amenity is the most popular in Indiana, where it is included in 7.2 percent of listings, according to the report.\n\n\"It's an entertaining feature,\" Vivas says of fire pits. \"It's one of those things that can let you enjoy your home with more people.\"\n\nThe post originally appeared on Realtor.com\u00ae as \"The Outdoor Features That Will Boost Home Values the Most.\""

Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy announcement, Trump said he would be choosing the Reagan appointee's replacement from a list of 25 candidates the White House released last November. One of those candidates is Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah.\n\nSenator Lee is known for his staunch conservativism. Upon learning he was on the list of replacements, Lee told \"Fox and Friends\" that he has been watching Supreme Court arguments since he was 10 \"for fun.\"\n\n\"I started at that age watching Supreme Court arguments just for fun, going with dad to the court, and so I'm honored just to be considered.\"\n\nSenator Mike Lee joins Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to discuss how he feels about being considered for the Supreme Court nomination.\n\nOn Justice Kennedy's legacy: Having served for 30 years on the Supreme Court of the United States he's had a significant impact. He's been a consistent champion for a number of things I think are important, including federalism and separation of powers. These twin structural protections in the constitution. He's also been a champion for individual liberty, for religious freedom. He has earnestly strived every day for justice. Even though i haven't always agreed with him on every decision I have to respect his tenacity his work ethic and his commitment to the rule of the law. (1:00)\n\nOn the judicial philosophy he thinks is looking for in next Supreme Court Justice: I think as a member of Senate judiciary committee that the best supreme court candidate, the best nominee, would be someone who has a strong commitment to reading and interpreting the text, the text of a statute or the text of the U.S. Constitution, as the case may require. And someone who has a view that there is a a right answer in a case. You have to do the hard work to find it, but when you're asking to interpret a stature or provision of the constitution you have to figure out what the words mean. (1:49)\n\nOn if there was a Democratic president selecting a Democratic Senator You raise a very important point that someone's judicial philosophy doesn't necessarily match up with what would be their judicial philosophy someone's political philosophy might be in one direction, but if their judicial philosophy were different I'd take that into account and they don't always line up. Sometimes they do but not necessarily. (3:17)\n\nOn the kind of justice that could pass the Senate: Look no one is certain to get anyone's vote at the outset of a process and I'm not gonna speak for any one of my colleagues or for my colleagues as a group as to which judicial candidate they might vote to confirm. I think that question is one that can't be answered in the abstract and would have to be answered under the totality of the circumstance. (4:56)\n\nOn if Schumer made a mistake on insisting on filibustering Gorsuch: In my view that's when the executive calendar was nuked. In other words, it was in November of 2013 that Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats decided to just conclude with a simple majority. That culture had been achieved even though they had only a simple majority and not the 3/5th's super majority required for closure. Once that happened that was inevitable that that would be the outcome on the executive counter. Meaning that when we're dealing with nominations the new standard would be a simple majority and so yeah, perhaps he shouldn't have done it there. (7:07)\n\nOn why this is different than Merrick Garland: Two significant differences. it's not a presidential election year but even more importantly the party that is in control of the senate is also in control of the white house. The democrats might not like that, but that is reality (9:28)\n\nListen below:"

While I was there I spent time with the brave men and women who work to keep our nation safe and secure.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s time for my Final Thoughts.\n\nNo one likes to see families torn apart. But as I\u2019ve said before, and I\u2019ll say again: The best way to ensure your family stays together is to NOT cross into the U.S. illegally.\n\nYes, some of the people coming here can rightfully claim asylum. BUT \u2026 those with legitimate, credible claims should do it the right way \u2013 after legally accessing a U.S. port of entry! They shouldn\u2019t trek across the blazing hot desert, or swim across the Rio Grande, and expect the U.S. to roll out the red carpet, no questions asked.\n\nOur border patrol agents are fantastic people. I am honored to have spent time with them at the border last week. https://t.co/yWaT98e6kP pic.twitter.com/REXdMIwal3 \u2014 Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) June 26, 2018\n\nLet\u2019s also recognize not all of these \u2013 quote, \u201cfamily units\u201d \u2013 are really families. Criminal organizations and human smugglers \u2013 known as coyotes \u2013 are using some of these children as pawns.\n\nIt\u2019s not just people illegally coming across the border, either: It\u2019s drugs and crime. Border patrol agents so far this year have seized 39,510 pounds of cocaine, 3,316 pounds of heroin, 206,883 pounds of marijuana, 45,896 pounds of methamphetamine, and 984 pounds of Fentanyl.\n\nIf the open border loving liberals had their way, those drugs would be flowing freely into your communities.\n\nThe left is unfairly demonizing our border patrol agents \u2013 who are tasked with not only protecting U.S. citizens, but also illegal immigrants. Just last year, agents rescued 3,221 illegal migrants in dangerous and, in some cases, life-threatening situations.\n\nThe left doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. They won\u2019t mention that Latinos today represent more than half the Border Patrol Agent workforce, because that information would get in the way of their race-baiting arguments.\n\nDon\u2019t let the leftist propaganda fool you: Our border patrol agents aren\u2019t cold-hearted. They aren\u2019t racist. They are not monsters. They are humanitarians, with an important and challenging job.\n\nInstead of slamming them, we should be thanking them for the work they do.\n\nSo, if some of people are trying to ignite a war on border patrol agents, like they did the war on cops, THEY are the problem. THEY are ungrateful. THEY are utterly misinformed.\n\nThose are my final thoughts. From LA, God Bless and take care."

			"text": "article\n\nA shrewd small business owner is always scouring the horizon, looking for proverbial dark clouds that threaten to upend the landscape of supply and demand.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHowever, an even shrewder small business owner is always scouring the horizon, looking for real dark clouds that threaten to upend the landscape with high winds and torrential rain.\n\nAlthough no business is safe from Mother Nature's fury, major storms such as hurricanes and Nor'easters are particularly damaging to small business. Nearly 40% of small businesses close after a disaster, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAnd if a storm shutters a small business, there's a good chance it stays shuttered for good. Only 25% of businesses that close due to a major disaster ever reopen, according to the Institute for Business & Home Safety.\n\nAlthough those statistics are admittedly bleak, it's not impossible to weather a terrible storm.\n\nIrma: An Unwanted Visitor\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's all about having a plan,\" said Roberto Torres, owner of Black & Denim, a boutique clothing store with 3 locations in Tampa.\n\nTorres was one of the thousands of small business owners who found themselves in the crosshairs of Hurricane Irma as the storm made landfall in Florida on September 10, 2017.\n\nAlthough Torres had an emergency plan ready to go, he was hopeful he wouldn't need it. \"They were saying it was going to turn and go out the Atlantic,\" Torres added. \"But as the storm neared, the track changed and we knew that wasn't going to happen.\"\n\nIn Miami, restaurateur Graziano Sbroggio was also hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. As the owner of 7 restaurants, including Spris Pizzeria, a hotspot in Miami Beach, he survived Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and knew preparation would be critical. \"We prepared as much as we could,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Columbia Restaurant Group also rapidly put its contingency storm plans in place. \"With the hurricane spanning the width of Florida, all 13 of our restaurants were in harm\u2019s way,\" explained Michael Kilgore, the firm's Marketing Director. \"Our executive team was meeting daily to monitor developments and to tweak our plan on the fly.\"\n\nAbout 48 hours ahead of impact, all of these small business owners - and many others - shifted into high gear.\n\nKnowing their human resources were their most valuable resources, they all made the welfare of their employees priority one. We implemented an internal communications tree,\" Kilgore explained, for efficient and fast messaging before, during and after the storm.\n\nThe owners also gathered supplies needed to secure their businesses.\n\nBecause two of his stores are located in Tampa's historic district, Torres knew the panes of his windows were a top priority. Too fragile to withstand hurricane force winds, he spent a lot of time and money boarding up the glass.\n\nSbroggio took down awnings, and brought everything inside that wasn't bolted down. \"I've done this before, and in the days before a hurricane, everyone lends a hand.\" The restaurant owners also tested their generators, critical in the event of a power outage.\n\nAs the storm approached, the atmosphere grew tense. Everyone closed well in advance of landfall, and as the hour of impact drew near, these small business owners hunkered down in their homes with family and friends. \"That's all we could do.\" Torres said.\n\nThe Moment Arrives\n\nFor much of Florida, the worst of the storm hit Sunday night and early Monday morning. At the storm's midpoint, Sbroggio spoke of an eerie quiet interrupted by the sounds of tornado alarms. Torres remembered tree limbs from high above snapping and crashing to the ground.\n\nAlthough some small businesses were devastated by Irma, the preparation and the prayers paid off for these entrepreneurs. The biggest challenge for all of them involved downed power lines and the impact of not having electricity for several days.\n\nFor Graziano Sbroggio and the Columbia Restaurant Group, those generators tested ahead of the storm powered refrigerators that prevented food from going bad. Food costs can be one of the most difficult costs to manage in the best of weather, let alone a hurricane.\n\nAt Black & Denim power loss shuttered stores for 3 days. \"In the end we lost thousands of dollars in sales,\" Torres admitted, \u201cBut nothing that couldn't be managed. I feel like we dodged a bullet.\"\n\nThe Lesson\n\nAccording to FEMA, out of 859 businesses that responded to the Florida Economic Opportunity Department survey, 724 (84.3%) small businesses lost sales due to Hurricane Irma, with 208 (24.2%) unable to open their primary business location, at least temporarily.\n\nWhen asked how they were able to make it through the storm relatively unscathed, Graziano Sbroggio, Roberto Torres and Michael Kilgore, all agreed that the plans they made long before the storm ever appeared on any radar screen played a central role in their success.\n\n\"We were very fortunate,\" said Kilgore, who recommended small businesses make a checklist so every action that needs to be taken before a storm is spelled out clearly. It also ensures small but important details are not overlooked.\n\n\"Carry the proper insurance and keep important documents accessible,\" said Torres, who felt insurance provided him with some peace of mind.\n\n\"Also keep cash handy,\" Sbroggio added. \"And of course, pray!\"\n\nLee Howard is a freelance writer who has been covering finance, consumer and business news for more than 20 years.

Over many thousands of years, Native Americans and early Europeans coined the names, based on what was happening in their rural, northern-hemispheric world at the time.\n\nIn January there\u2019s the Wolf Moon, because in the dead of winter ravenous wolves on the prowl for food cry out at night.\n\nIn February there\u2019s the Snow Moon, because that\u2019s typically when the ground is most deeply covered with the white stuff.\n\nIn March there\u2019s the Worm Moon, because in early spring the ground softens, inviting armies of robins to forage for earthworms.\n\nIn April there\u2019s the Pink Moon, named after pink moss, a creeping wildflower in the phlox family whose tiny petals in early spring herald the coming flowering season.\n\nIn May there\u2019s the Flower Moon, celebrating the month\u2019s veritable explosion of colorful blossoms.\n\nIn June there\u2019s the Strawberry Moon, AKA the Hot Moon, because the summer solstice \u2013 the longest day of the year \u2013 marks the start of summer heat.\n\nIn July there\u2019s the Buck Moon, when male deer begin re-growing antlers, which they shed in winter.\n\nIn August there\u2019s the Sturgeon Moon, when North America\u2019s lakes, rivers, and coastal waters teem with the long, sleek, weighty fish \u2013 a staple in the early Native American diet.\n\nIn September there\u2019s the well-known Harvest Moon, when the moon\u2019s orbital dynamics make for an especially bright full moon \u2013 giving farmers extra light by which to harvest their crops.\n\nIn October there\u2019s the Hunter\u2019s Moon, whose extra-bright light makes it easier for hunters to stalk fatted game animals at night and thus store up provisions for the coming winter.\n\nIn November there\u2019s the Beaver Moon, when trappers of old hastened to bag a winter\u2019s worth of furs before ponds and swamps froze \u2013 and beavers themselves are busy shoring up their dams for the winter.\n\nAnd finally, in December there\u2019s the Cold Moon, when the winter solstice \u2013 the shortest day of the year (a day, ironically, I celebrate) \u2013 marks the start of the coldest season of the year.\n\nAs a kid growing up in East Los Angeles, I didn\u2019t relate at all to these stories. My day-to-day world was concrete, asphalt, and traffic \u2013 not wolves, sturgeon, and beavers.\n\nBut now that my family and I choose to dwell in the countryside \u2013 we just purchased a small ranch in northern Texas and couldn\u2019t be happier \u2013 my perspective in life has changed dramatically. Not just on the various full moons and the stories behind them, but on just about everything.\n\nHow could it not? Years ago, for instance, after watching wild strawberries gradually ripen amongst fields of wildflowers on our 1778 Massachusetts farmstead and then plucking them in June, at the peak of their sweetness \u2013 wow! \u2013 that\u2019s when my taste buds first discovered what a truly special time of year this is. The time of the Strawberry Moon.\n\nI will never willingly go back to living in a city. After all, God is said to have placed us in a garden, not an urban jungle. Every time I venture into a bustling metropolis \u2013 be it my native Los Angeles or London, or New York or Cairo \u2013 my stress levels shoot up and I feel horribly separated from the wonders of nature.\n\nSo, Thursday night \u2013 as I did last night \u2013 after the sun sets on the sweeping, picturesque landscape of northern Texas, I will step out my front door and \u2013 far away from city lights that pollute the night sky \u2013 I will gawk at the rising moon, mindful of the beauty of God\u2019s creation and the extraordinary native people whose legacy deserves to be remembered and cherished for many, many moons to come."

According to the Daily Mail, cops caught Kelley and another man, Richard Wilcutt, in a car with an improperly installed license plate in the parking lot of the drugstore. During their questioning, pseudoephedrine and a receipt for Coleman fuel were found in a bag that had been thrown outside of their car. As the items are ingredients typically used to cook meth, both Wilcutt and Kelley were arrested on charges of meth manufacture promotion.\n\nA year later, Kelley was arrested in Alabama and was cited as a fugitive from the law.\n\nIn May 2017, Judd and Arch Kelley\u2019s daughter pleaded guilty to cooking and selling meth, according to Radar. Though she was originally supposed to go behind bars for almost a year, the outlet reported that her sentence was changed to probation after only 30 days behind bars. Kelley was then released the following month from Williamson County Detention Center where she continued her court-ordered drug program but has since broken the probation.\n\n\"The defendant was terminated from the recovery court program on November 21, 2017,\" a spokesperson for Williamson County told Radar. \"A warrant for probation violation was issued on November 22, 2017, and served on December 16, 2017.\"\n\nIf Kelley serves out her eight-year sentence, her release date from prison would be 2025 though she may be eligible for parole in 2019.\n\nA rep for Judd did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment."

			"text": "Plain or piled with toppings, a great burger is the king of any cookout.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever volunteered to wield the tongs, you know the pressure\u2019s on. The pitfalls of a seemingly simple burger are legion: too dry, overdone, underdone, oddly tough, falling apart, charred outside but somehow raw in the middle \u2014 and there\u2019s only so much ketchup can cover up.\n\nWant to grill a tender, juicy burger with just the right blush of pink in the middle? Avoid these common mistakes cooks make when grilling burgers.\n\nMistake #1: Relying on pre-made patties\n\nPicking up a bag of pre-made burger patties at the grocery store is definitely tempting, especially if you\u2019re pressed for time. But the best results start with the freshest possible meat. You\u2019ll also have more control over the type and fat content of your meat (more on that in #2).\n\nBesides, it\u2019s ridiculously simple to make burger patties from scratch \u2014 check out our step-by-step guide.\n\nMistake #2: Grabbing the wrong pack of meat\n\nYou can make delicious burgers from ground turkey, ground chicken or even black beans, like these. But when it comes to making the best-ever burger, we like to stick to the classic: ground beef.\n\nThe real trick here is to choose ground beef with a higher fat content. The leaner the beef, the drier your burger will be. Ground sirloin is the leanest, then ground round, ground chuck and lastly, ground beef. The package will tell you the lean-to-fat ratio. 85-15 is too low for a tasty burger; it\u2019ll be too dry. But 70-30 makes a super juicy, indulgent burger, and it\u2019s our favorite to cook with.\n\nMistake #3: Over-handling the meat\n\nWe love adding seasonings, spices and extra ingredients to boost the flavor of our burgers. (Garlic powder and chopped onions are my faves.) But over-mixing and mashing the meat will turn it into a dense, dry puck.\n\nAn easy trick to avoid overworking: Combine any add-ins in a separate bowl first. Then, gently work the mixture into the ground meat by pressing it in with two forks. Stop as soon as the ingredients look evenly dispersed.\n\nMistake #4: Skipping the easy trick to making perfect patties\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever shaped a meatball or worked extensively with ground beef, you\u2019ll recognize this situation. Things begin smoothly as you mold the meat into shape. But then, gradually, globs of the greasy pink stuff start sticking to your fingers, making it harder and harder to manage. Pretty soon you can\u2019t form anything into shape.\n\nTo avoid the mess, start by dampening your hands with water. This\u2019ll prevent the meat from clinging as you shape the burgers.\n\nMistake #5: Making patties too petite\n\nGround meat will shrink as it sizzles on the grill. The more fat that\u2019s in the meat, the more it\u2019ll shrink.\n\nTo prevent burgers from becoming pint-sized, plan ahead. Shape the raw patties to be slightly larger than the bun. You also don\u2019t want the patties to be too thin or too fat. Too fat, and the outside will char before the inside cooks. Too thin, and the patty will lose too much moisture, becoming dry fast.\n\nWe like to shape our ours into 4-inch rounds that are about 1/2-inch thick. The beef will plump slightly as it cooks.\n\nReader Tip: \u201cWhen shaping hamburger patties, I poke a hole through the center of each one with my index finger. The burgers cook faster this way, and the outside doesn\u2019t get overcooked before the center is done. As the burgers cook, the hole almost disappears-it\u2019s barely noticeable when they\u2019re done. This works whether you grill, broil or cook burgers in a skillet.\u201d \u2014 Jean K., Golden, Colorado\n\nMistake #6: Not letting the grill heat up enough\n\nBurgers are best cooked over medium heat. A gas grill will fire up relatively quickly. But if you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, it\u2019s a bit trickier to tell since it takes some time for the charcoal to catch fire and the kettle to warm up.\n\nGauge the temperature of your grill by following this simple trick: Hold your hand about 4 inches above the coals. If you can keep it there for 4 to 5 seconds (or as my grandma\u2019s old copy of \"Joy of Cooking\" puts it, \u201cuntil you can say Mississippi twice\u201d) the grill\u2019s heat is medium. (For more grilling wisdom, check out our guide for using a charcoal grill.)\n\nMistake #7: Pressing the patties as they cook\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen it in movies and on TV \u2014 the cook takes his spatula and presses it down on the patties as they cook, releasing a fury of spit and sizzle.\n\nThis is a huge mistake. That cook is effectively squeezing out all the meat\u2019s juices, dropping them into the flames below. As satisfying as it looks on screen, don\u2019t do this at home.\n\nMistake #8: Testing for doneness on a timer (or by eye)\n\nYou should invest in a good instant-read thermometer. (Psst: You can pick one up for cheap in the gadget aisle of most supermarkets.) Not only will you feel like a pro as you wield it, but it\u2019ll give you more confidence as you cook.\n\nHere\u2019s our rule: Use a timer for guidance, and a thermometer for a final check.\n\nGrill the burgers for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Then take the temperature. Use tongs to hold the burger while inserting the metal spear of the thermometer horizontally through the patty. Make sure the thermometer is positioned in the center. Beef, pork and lamb burgers should reach 160 degrees, while chicken or turkey burgers should be cooked to 165 degrees.\n\nAvoid these burger blunders and you\u2019ll be the hero of your next holiday cookout and backyard barbecue. Just remember to take a break from the heat and sneak in a round or two of cornhole."

			"text": "Way, way back in 2002 I wrote a book about the domino effect that occurs when women try to raise children, babies and toddlers in particular, and pursue full-time career simultaneously. The subtitle of the book (which has since been re-released as \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Parents Are Choosing to Stay Home\u201d ) was \u201cWhy Children and Most Careers Just Don\u2019t Mix,\u201d and its overall message was that the needs and demands of children are so great that to try and meet those needs and demands after being spent from a day at the office is fruitless. What\u2019s more, it yanks the joy of motherhood right out of you.\n\nI wrote that book to help women who\u2019ve been taught to map out their futures without giving any thought at all to how their lives will change down the road when they become mothers. Not only are women surprised to find out how taxing motherhood is, they don\u2019t anticipate how much they\u2019d want to be with their babies.\n\nNeedless to say, I was lambasted in the media for daring to write a book that outlined the costs of working motherhood. But fifteen years later, the results are in.\n\nA new report by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that women today \u201cfrequently underestimate the time, money and effort it takes to raise children and have a career at the same time, leading many to invest in their skills and then reluctantly leave the workforce when the true costs of being a working mother become apparent,\u201d writes Lauren Weber at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDespite this reality, the message isn\u2019t getting across to younger women. According to the NBER report, female high school seniors \u201care increasingly and substantially overestimating the likelihood they will be in the labor market in their thirties.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s a logical follow-up question: Why don\u2019t young women understand what children, babies in particular, need? And why do they assume they\u2019ll be just as career-driven in their thirties as they were in their twenties?\n\nI\u2019ll answer those questions with two more questions: Why wouldn\u2019t modern women be in the dark about motherhood? And why wouldn\u2019t they assume they\u2019d never leave the workforce?\n\nSince the day they were born, college-bound women have been groomed for a life at the office rather than for a life at home. No one told them their priorities will shift down the line. No one told them how overwhelming motherhood is without a career, let alone with one. Most importantly, no one told them how joyful motherhood can be.\n\nIn previous generations, women embraced this transformation and viewed marriage and family not just as the center of their lives but as the purpose of life. Modern women, by contrast, view a career as their life\u2019s purpose and assume they can squeeze marriage and family in around this otherwise more pressing endeavor \u2013 if they squeeze it in at all.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that by the time the average woman hits 30, the likelihood of her deciding that marriage and motherhood, not career, is the most important thing in her life is astronomically high. Too many women needlessly wind up in a quandary when they become mothers. Many are shocked to discover that what they thought was important before they had children feels utterly irrelevant afterward.\n\nIf we know this to be true, why don\u2019t we help young women better prepare for their futures? Why should young women map out their lives as though husbands and babies aren\u2019t going to come along and happily put a wrench in those plans? Why don\u2019t we change the question and ask not what motherhood\u2019s effect on employment will be but what effect employment will have on a woman when she becomes a mother?\n\nOf course the culture will never ask this question, so it\u2019s up to parents to circumvent the narrative their daughters will invariably receive. I have a daughter who\u2019s headed off to college in the fall, and like most girls she plans to get married and have children someday. Great, I told her. Here are three important things you need to know:\n\n1. Whom you choose to marry will have more effect on your happiness and well-being than any other choice you make in life. So make sure you focus at least as much on getting that decision right as you do on nailing down a career.\n\n2. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll always be in the workforce. Trying to juggle full-time work while raising babies isn\u2019t just stressful, it\u2019s unfair to your yet-to-be-born children. Babies have needs that must be met, and a mother is in the best position to meet those needs. The attempt to \u2018have it all\u2019 is futile. Something always suffers, and it\u2019s usually the kids \u2013 as Indra K. Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, courageously admitted in 2014. Knowing this in advance can help you make smart decisions in life and in love.\n\n3. Don\u2019t forget that your body has an agenda of its own. You have a window with which to conceive children the natural way. If you put motherhood off too long, you invite unnecessary hardship \u2013 physically, financially and psychologically \u2013 into your life. For most women, this is completely avoidable.\n\nThat women today are unprepared for motherhood isn\u2019t the least bit surprising. But the onus is on their parents and the culture, who insisted that women focus on their educations and careers to the exclusion of everything else. \u201cIf I could go back ten years,\u201d Rachel Lehmann-Haupt writes in \u201cThe Aniston Syndrome,\u201d \u201cI would tell my younger self that she should deeply consider her future family\u2026I wonder whether in fact my generation collectively screwed up.\u201d\n\nIndeed."

			"text": "How to plant grass seed is a question that eventually crops up for homeowners whose lawns start looking a little thin. In fact, even if your lawn looks perfect, you should still be seeding regularly to keep it in top shape.\n\n\"Seeding your lawn can make it less susceptible to pests, disease, and weeds,\" says Jim Fanning, president of Evergreen Lawn and Pest Control of Orlando, Fla. \"When you have strong, healthy grass, weeds have a harder time competing for nutrients and water.\"\n\nIn this latest installment of our Lawn Lover's Guide, we'll fill you in on everything you need to know on how to plant grass seed to keep your lawn looking its best.\n\nHow to seed a lawn\n\nFirst off, odds are you'll want to grab bags of grass seed that are the same strain you already have growing (bring a sample to the nursery if you're not sure). From there, your plans will depend on the problem you're trying to fix. Here are some guidelines for each situation:\n\nTo fill in bare spots (patching): Bare spots can be caused by spilled fertilizer or chemicals, or pets regularly relieving themselves in a certain area. The good news? They are easy to fix.\n\nPrep the area. Rake the bare area to remove any debris (e.g., dead grass and weeds), and loosen the soil to help the tiny seedlings take root once they sprout, says Kevin Shanks, a manager of retail training at Scotts Miracle-Gro. Apply the seed. Sprinkle the bare spot until it's mostly covered with seed but the ground beneath is still visible. When watered, the mulch in the seeding product will expand to fill the entire area and help keep the seed covered and moist. Water well. Thoroughly water the newly seeded area until no more water is absorbed. Continue to water daily (or as needed) for at least two weeks, or until the seedlings are 2 inches tall.\n\nTo thicken a thin lawn (overseeding): With each passing year, the wear and tear on your lawn can cause it to become thin. Thin lawn repair, sometimes referred to as overseeding, can help return your yard to its original lushness.\n\nMow low. Set your mower to one of its lowest settings, and cut your grass so that it\u2019s no more than 2 inches tall. Make sure you bag your clippings. Prep the area. After mowing, rake the lawn to remove any remaining dead grass and debris and loosen the top layer of soil. This will help the grass seedlings take root once they sprout. Buy or rent a seed spreader. A drop or broadcast seed spreader can be purchased at your local home improvement store for as little as $12 for a handheld unit, or as much as $150 for one with wheels (the larger options are also rentable). A drop spreader, which will drop grass seed directly onto the lawn beneath the spreader, is typically recommended for small lawns. A broadcast spreader, which will spray or broadcast the seed widely, is a better bet for larger lawns. Apply the product. This is the easy part. Make sure your spreader is set to off, and fill with seed. Set the flow rate \u2014 the speed at which the seed will be sent out \u2014 according to unit directions. Depending on the model you've purchased, you may be able to then set it to remain on as you walk around your yard. You'll want to cover the whole yard, so it's best to walk the full length of your lawn, then back the other way, in much the same pattern you'd take to mow your lawn. Water regularly. Keep the soil surface moist by watering daily or as needed for the first two weeks. Resume mowing when the lawn reaches the desired mowing height.\n\nTo start a new lawn (reseeding): When your lawn is more weeds than grass or is dry and damaged beyond repair, it\u2019s time for a complete do-over.\n\n\"A reseeding project lets you start your lawn over with a clean slate,\" Shanks says.\n\nHere's what you need to do.\n\nClear the area. Start by killing any remaining poor-looking grass and all weeds with a nonselective herbicide about two weeks before you want to seed your lawn, Shanks suggests. Once everything is dead, rake the area to remove the debris. Aerate the soil. If your soil is really compact, now is a great time to aerate your lawn, Shanks says. \"After aerating, use a rake to level out any uneven areas and loosen the top quarter-inch of soil,\" he notes. You'll want to follow up with a 1-inch layer of lawn soil, spread evenly across the entire area. Select your grass seed. You can start from scratch, so choose a grass seed that is right for your location. In the South, warm-season grass types such as Bermuda, zoysia, centipede, and bahia are popular. In the North, lawns do better with cool-season grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, fine fescue, or perennial ryegrass. Apply the product. Once your soil is prepped, fill your spreader with seed, adjust the spreader settings according to the label directions, and go for it. Feed for growth. After spreading the grass seed, apply fertilizer geared to help new grass grow to give seedlings needed nutrients so they can develop a deep root system. Water daily. Proper watering is a critical step to seeding success. Keep the soil surface moist by watering daily or as needed until the seedlings reach at least 2 inches tall.\n\nHow often should you seed a lawn?\n\nOnce you've seeded your lawn, you have about five to six years until grass growth will slow down.\n\n\"This can lead to those thinner patches, so the ideal time to overseed and fill it in is every three to four years,\" Fanning says. \"You can also reseed in patches if there are thin spots.\"\n\nIf you're growing grass in an area that gets a lot of foot traffic or that has trouble standing up to temperatures, flooding, insects, or disease, you may need to plant grass seed more frequently.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Realtor.com as \"How to Plant Grass Seed: A Lawn Lover's Guide.\""

About four miles into the journey, the 21-year-old\u2019s hiking poles broke, launching her 300 feet down a snowy mountain. Milling then collided with a large boulder and slid about another 400 feet down the mountain, ABC News reported.\n\nDOG MISSING NEARLY A YEAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WOODS REUNITES WITH OWNERS: 'HE IS ONE TRUE SURVIVOR'\n\nLanding at the bottom of the trail, Milling was bruised and shaken, but found a \"guardian angel\" in her path: a white Alaskan husky dog named Nanook.\n\n\"When I first saw Nanook\u2026 I thought he was a wolf. Then I saw the little collar and realized he was there to help me,\u201d the Tennessee native and Rochester Institute of Technology student told the outlet.\n\nFollowing the dog back to Crow Pass Trail, Nanook stayed with Milling all night, and even pulled her out of the water by her backpack straps when she unsuccessfully attempted to cross through the freezing waters of Eagle River Crossing.\n\nWhen she became hypothermic, she activated her emergency SPOT device for aid, ABC 11 reported, and the pair was soon rescued by an Alaska State Troopers helicopter.\n\nLOST RABBIT CAUSED BOMB SCARE AT AUSTRALIAN AIRPORT\n\n\u201cNookie was nothing short of a modern-day Lassie hero,\u201d Alaska State Trooper Lt.

The Commerce Department launched the probe under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, the same provision used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nThe Commerce Department said it has received approximately 2,500 comments and expects more comments to be submitted before a midnight deadline Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for [July 19-20] is to make sure that all stakeholders\u2019 views are heard, both pro and con,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement. \u201cThat will enable us to make our best informed recommendation to the president.\u201d\n\nAlthough a tariff on cars would apply to foreign-made cars shipped into the U.S., American automakers have voiced concerns that the EU and other regions could retaliate. Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d and other manufacturers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, export vehicles from U.S. factories to overseas markets.\n\nAmong the U.S. vehicles that GM builds overseas are the Buick Cascada, which is assembled in Poland, and the German-made Buick Regal.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg GM GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 39.40 -1.12 -2.76%\n\nToyota also submitted comments to the Commerce Department on Friday, saying import tariffs would \u201cdisrupt\u201d U.S.-based production by depriving plants for key parts.\n\nGerman automakers are said to be urging the Trump administration and the EU to set car tariffs to 0%. The U.S. currently charges a 2.5% tariff on EU cars, while the EU\u2019s tariff on American vehicles is 10%.\n\nEU President Jean-Claude Juncker plans to visit Washington next month to meet with Trump to discuss trade, a spokesperson for Juncker said Friday."

The 46-year-old is believed to have fled in a car with the armed accomplices.\n\nCONNECTICUT MAN WHO SHOT PARENTS TO DEATH SENTENCED TO 55 YEARS IN PRISON\n\nThe escape on Sunday was the second time Faid had escaped from a French prison. In 2013, he blasted his way out of prison with explosives concealed in tissue packs before he was arrested at a hotel six weeks later.\n\nFaid was once France's most-wanted man and previously said his life of crime was inspired by films such as \"Scarface,\" according to AFP.\n\nIn the 1990s, Faid led a criminal gang involved in armed robbery of banks and armored vans transporting money. He was arrested in 1998 after three years on the run in Switzerland and Israel, according to the French media.\n\nFaid was freed in 2009 after serving 10 years in prison. At the time he swore that he had turned his life around, writing a confessional book about his life of crime and going on an extensive media tour in 2010.\n\nFaid was sentenced to 25 years for his role as the suspected mastermind of an attempted armed robbery that led to the 2010 death of 26-year-old policewoman Aurelie Fouquet, who was killed in a shootout, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFaid was convicted of the murder of the policewoman, along with two accomplices.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Kirsten Gillibrand, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and Mayor Bill de Blasio both advocated abolishing ICE this week. Another possible presidential candidate, California Sen.

Elizabeth Warren called for \"replacing ICE\" in a rally on Saturday.\n\nWATCH: TRUMP SAYS DEMS WILL GET BEATEN 'BADLY' IF THEY CAMPAIGN ON ABOLISHING ICE\n\nBut Klobuchar refused to endorse that approach, and instead insisted that the focus should be on immigration policy.\n\n\"I think what has to change are the policies, and the people that are making these policies are making horrendous decisions like separating kids from their parents,\" she said on \"This Week.\"\n\n\"I am just appalled by how this administration has been talking about immigrants,\" she added.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Connecticut Democratic Sen.

			"text": "Media furor was aroused last week by four major Supreme Court cases that went against the left and by a Supreme Court retirement that will enable President Trump to appoint a solidly conservative justice to the high court. That was followed by a horrific mass shooting at a Maryland newspaper that some journalists tried to link to criticism the president has leveled at the media.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court dominated much of the week. Each successive ruling seemed to infuriate journalists and liberals more. But Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s announcement of his retirement was the last straw.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Correspondent Terry Moran set the ominous tone, saying that Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u201cguarantees that this court and this country is going to change profoundly.\u201d\n\nOthers called the nomination of a new justice an \u201cearthquake\u201d or an incident that would evolve into \u201ca months-long bare-knuckle fight over this nominee.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s legal team acted as if the Constitution itself was at risk because the high court is now expected to move farther right. Topics like abortion and religious freedom dominated the coverage.\n\nCNN Legal Analyst Laura Coates said the retirement of Kennedy means even more. There are \u201ca whole host of areas where we require a swing vote for other more progressive-minded notions and ones that, frankly, are in line with our democratic principles and we don't have that now,\u201d she warned.\n\nConservatives aren\u2019t allowed to have \u201cdemocratic principles,\u201d it seems.\n\nCNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin was particularly overwrought. He warned gay customers who patronize businesses owned by religious conservatives that \u201cyou will not be able to buy a hotel room, be served in a restaurant, buy a wedding cake.\u201d\n\nMany other outlets were nearly as hyperbolic: The Daily Beast warned of a \u201cjudicial apocalypse.\u201d Slate\u2019s Dan Kois wrote about his own \u201cfrothing, incoherent rage.\u201d Seldom funny \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah complained that President Trump was \u201cgiving America judicial herpes.\u201d\n\nCoverage continued to spin out of control once the media started asking about next steps. MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d host Chris Matthews argued that the fight over Kennedy\u2019s replacement was \u201cgoing to be almost like Spanish Civil War stuff.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that hundreds of thousands of people died in that civil war.\n\nMatthews warned Democratic leaders that they must \u201cprevent the Republican-controlled Senate to pick another justice on this hard-right court.\u201d\n\nSlate was more straightforward. It reported that a more conservative Supreme Court would be one \u201cthat subverts American democracy for decades.\u201d\n\nJournalists are unable to grasp how the prospect of a more conservative court actually makes tens of millions of Americans positively giddy. That narrative was almost impossible to find.\n\n2. Journalists Defend Abortion, Again: Abortion is one of the most sacred \u201crights\u201d for the media. This becomes obvious any time defunding Planned Parenthood becomes a key news topic. That factored heavily into coverage of the Supreme Court vacancy.\n\n\u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host and resident Democratic donor Gayle King couldn\u2019t help herself and asked conservative Leonard Leo, of the Federalist Society: \u201cBut should we be worried about Roe v. Wade going away?\u201d\n\nWe.\n\nCNN\u2019s Toobin continued his panic, predicting that abortion will be banned in 10 to 20 states in less than two years once President Trump appoints another conservative to the Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade, he warned, is \u201cdoomed and abortion will be illegal in a significant chunk of this country in 18 months.\u201d\n\nHollywood embraced the Toobin narrative. Cher tweeted breathlessly: \u201cSome Americans could find themselves in internment camps!!\u201d Actor Don Cheadle claimed that \u201call of our rights are in the balance.\u201d Actress Bette Midler cited a famous anti-fascist book in her tweet: \u201cAnd you thought it couldn\u2019t happen here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe View\u201d outdid itself in kooky commentary. Host Whoopi Goldberg went on a lengthy rant that ended with: \u201cGet out of my behind! Get out of my vagina! Get out!\u201d Her co-host Joy Behar whined that the GOP might end up controlling all three branches of government. \u201cWhat is that called? Dictatorship I believe!\u201d\n\n3. Blaming Trump: The shooting deaths of five employees at the Capital Gazette newspaper near Annapolis, Maryland drove some in the media to blame President Trump. A Massachusetts reporter resigned after making a false claim that the shooter had dropped a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during the attack. Reuters Breakingviews Editor Rob Cox apologized for tying President Trump to the incident, after it was discovered the shooter had a longstanding fight with the paper.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Jim Acosta turned full-scale heckler, shouting at the president during an event this week: \"Mr. President, will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people?\u201d He was so distracting, one guest even shushed him. Acosta tweeted in response : \u201cWe also had a few folks who shushed is in the audience. Of course we are not going to be shushed.\u201d\n\n4. Socialism Will Work This Time, They Promise: The media were agog over the Democratic primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old member of the Democratic Socialists of America for a congressional seat representing part of New York City. The New York Times dubbed her \u201can instant political rock star,\u201d helped in huge part that she\u2019s in the Big Apple and only slightly to the left of the staff at The Times.\n\nHer campaign platform has more giveaways than a TV game show and so-called neutral journalists absolutely adore her. Reporters didn\u2019t focus on how socialist nations take away rights and murder their citizens. They didn\u2019t even inquire about her stance on Venezuela, where things are so bad that citizens broke into the zoo \u2026 to cook up the animals.\n\nNo, journalists focused on her lipstick.\n\nI almost hate myself for even writing that word. Lipstick. The first one of these discredited, unprofessional stories came from People magazine. It was headlined: \u201cCongressional Primary Victor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Reveals Her Power Red Lipstick Shade.\u201d\n\nRacked called the lipstick, \u201ca symbol of change.\u201d Refinery29 said it was \u201cMore Than Just A Color.\u201d Jezebel raved about how \u201cHer Lipstick Remained Intact.\u201d Allure, Quartz and others all gave her some lip. Then CBS broke the big news: \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez name-dropped her lipstick brand and it sold out.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez's lipstick is like Wendy Davis\u2019s tennis shoes. It\u2019s designed to make her appear like an everywoman, despite her far-left politics. This is socialism with a Madison Avenue marketing campaign.\n\nOf course, the other aspect of Ocasio-Cortez's surprising victory was how badly The New York Times missed it \u2013 right in its own backyard.\n\nFormer Times executive editor Jill Abramson accused her old paper of \u201cmaking horrible mistakes left and right.\u201d (Mostly left, but that\u2019s for another time.) Abramson did call out the paper and say \u201cit should have covered her campaign,\u201d instead of being surprised she had won.\n\nOuch."

The gunman who opened fire at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Maryland, killing five, barricaded the door to stop people from getting out and was bent on killing \"as many people as he could kill,\" police and prosecutors said. The mass shooting sent shockwaves through the journalism community and left investigators searching for answers. On Twitter and other social media, shreds of good news -- reporters and editors at the Capital pronouncing themselves safe -- were quickly overwhelmed by accusations and assumptions, mostly unfounded, about who was responsible and how the shootings fit into the story of a divided and angry nation. Guy & Marie sort through.\n\nOn Thin Ice? The idea was once relegated to the far-left. But the liberal push to abolish the federal agency that enforces federal immigration laws is going mainstream in the Democratic Party, with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio adding their support to the cause in the last 24 hours. \"I believe that has become a deportation force ... and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,\" Gillibrand said in a CNN interview Thursday night. \"We should abolish ICE,\" de Blasio said Friday morning on WNYC radio. Gillibrand's endorsement is notable as she's the first sitting senator to back the 'abolish ICE' push -- and is considered a potential 2020 presidential contender. They join numerous other Democratic candidates, House members, liberal commentators and writers who have fought back against the Trump administration's immigration policies by calling to gut ICE -- which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States.

The partner called 911 and began cutting off the plastic and tape.\u201d\n\nGeorge, who had a 16-year relationship with a man named Barry Shils that allowed for sexual activity outside their partnership, had become a regular playmate of Chasey's over the course of seven months preceeding his death.\n\nWhen parademics arrived, they were unable to revive George.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office was unable to determine the cause of death and Chasey has not been charged with any wrongdoing, reports Variety.\n\nChasey\u2019s lawyer, John Duran, told Variety that the two were participating in consensual activity and noted that the coroner did not conclude that the wrapping was the cause of George\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very sad and traumatic for Skip,\u201d Duran said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone he had an ongoing relationship with.

They developed expertise in areas of LGBTQ and Disability Studies, earned their doctorate in 2014, taught several classes and were \u201chighly respected, revered and adored\" by peers and students alike.\n\n\"Those of you who had the honor of taking this course or being in one of Doran\u2019s discussion sections know that their heart was as big as their laugh, and that their dedication to social justice was informed by their own queer immigrant experience,\" said Alicia Gaspar de Alba, a UCLA professor, in a separate note to colleagues.\n\nThe room in which George was found \u2014 replete with padded floor tiles, a metal cage and a padded examination table \u2014 was described as being \u201coutfitted as a BDSM style dungeon\u201d in the autopsy report.\n\nThe incident received renewed attention when it was discussed on a podcast called The Grey Zone.\n\nFor its part, the William Morris Endeavor agency has no plans to take action against Chasey.\n\n\u201cWhile we were unaware of the circumstances surrounding this personal matter until now, we understand that the police file is closed and no charges were brought. If other facts develop, we will re-evaluate the situation and determine any appropriate action to take,\u201d the agency said in a statement to Variety.\n\nTheir partner has been left with a sense of guilt over what took place.\n\n\"In my grief, I\u2019m hitting myself \u2014 like it was like watching my lover shoot heroin and not saying anything,\" Shils told The Hollywood Reporter. \"Never in my wildest dreams did I think he was going to end up dead.\""

It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period of time.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla had a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.\n\nMoney-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla's first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.\n\nProduction of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems with an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.\n\n\"It was pretty hectic,\" said one worker who described the atmosphere as \"all hands on deck.\"\n\nAnother worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a \"mass celebration.\"\n\nTesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed.\n\nThe company regularly engages in so-called \"burst builds,\" temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.\n\nAnalyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief \"burst rates\" of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.\n\nTesla said in May that its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nDespite touting the Model 3 as a $35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the higher-priced versions.\n\nTesla in January pushed back its target date for building 5,000 vehicles per week to the end of the second quarter, the latest in several delays that have concerned some investors.\n\nSteady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla's market value is close to that of General Motors Co <GM.N>. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.\n\nJune was turbulent for Tesla. It laid off 9 percent of its workforce, endured at least two fires at its Fremont, California plant and accused a former employee of engaging in sabotage for speaking to the media. The ex-worker claims he is a whistleblower.\n\nIn early June, Musk said it was \"quite likely\" that Tesla could deliver 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of quarter. At the time, Tesla was producing 3,500 of the vehicles per week, he said.\n\nAs the end of June approached, workers told Reuters that the company was building fewer than its 5,000-per week goal.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage and Sal Rodriguez; Editing by Peter Henderson, Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker)"

			"text": "Ticks are known to carry some nasty ailments, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. But one allergist and associate professor of medicine at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is warning that some of these small arachnids \u2014 specifically the Lone Star tick \u2014 can cause another issue as well: an allergy to red meat.\n\nWhile the allergy caused by a Lone Star tick bite is relatively rare, the number of cases has sharply increased from the roughly two dozen Dr. Scott Commins and his colleagues first studied in 2009, he told Fox News.\n\nCommins, who was one of the first physicians to discover the connection between Lone Star tick bites and the alpha-gal meat allergy, estimated that there are currently more than 5,000 cases in the U.S, with additional cases in countries such as Sweden and South Africa. There are 30,000 reported cases of Lyme disease in the nation each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nARKANSAS WOMAN DEVELOPS 'DEADLY' MEAT ALLERGY AFTER TICK BITE\n\nCommins identified a few factors that may explain the increase.\n\nFirst, doctors can now perform a blood test that detects the allergy, \u201cwhich has made the diagnosis much easier,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, the \u201crange of the Lone Star tick is increasing and expanding,\u201d Commins said, which ultimately increases the chance of getting bitten. Higher costs of living could partly be to blame, causing more people in recent years to trade urban life for the suburbs. This movement results in closer contact with tick-carrying deer, which subsequently increases the chance for tick bites.\n\nLastly, Commins said a heightnened awareness about the allergy has led those with symptoms to talk to their doctor and investigate if a Lone Star tick bite could be the cause.\n\nWith tick-borne diseases on the rise, here\u2019s what you need to know about the red meat allergy and how Lone Star ticks \u2014 named for the white spot on the back of adult females \u2014 are possibly to blame.\n\nHow do Lone Star tick bites result in a meat allergy?\n\nIn short: Scientists and physicians aren\u2019t exactly sure.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] not sure if the tick is causing the disease because of an infectious organism or not, but we have made the association with tick bites,\u201d he said, adding that the tick\u2019s saliva could be a factor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common pathogen in all of these ticks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a protein or enzyme in tick spit. We\u2019re working on that in the lab at the moment.\u201d\n\nCommins also suspects the allergy could have less to do with the tick itself and more about the tick\u2019s host.\n\nCDC: INFECTIONS FROM TICKS, MOSQUITOES SURGE IN US\n\nThere\u2019s a chance there could be a \u201csubtle mutation of a protein in a skin\u201d that makes certain people bitten by a Lone Star tick more susceptible to developing the allergy, he explained.\n\nIn other words, \u201cthere are 5,000 estimated cases in the U.S. Based on those odds, only a fraction of people develop the allergic response to red meat.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re bitten by a Lone Star tick, however, don\u2019t panic: it\u2019s not a guaranteed you\u2019ll develop the allergy. In fact, Commins called the chance \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nNot unlike the symptoms of a peanut, egg, tree nut or a shellfish allergy, many people who are allergic to red meat may experience hives, a skin rash or anaphylaxis.\n\nCommins warned that many also experience \u201csevere GI [gastrointestinal] distress,\u201d such as stomach pain, indigestion, vomiting and diarrhea. Some people have described their gastrointestinal symptoms as \u201cstabbing pain or [being stuck with] a hot poker,\u201d he added.\n\nUnlike those with a peanut or egg allergy, among others, the symptoms of a red meat allergy are not immediate. In fact, Commins said, it usually takes hours after eating red meat for the symptoms to appear.\n\nDOZENS DEVELOP RARE EYE CANCER IN A CASE THAT'S BAFFLING DOCTORS\n\n\u201cIf you wake up in the middle of the night with bad abdominal pain, you don't think food allergy,\u201d he said, explaining that the gastrointestinal symptoms can mimic those of a kidney stone or gallstones. This can lead to a misdiagnosis, leading some patients in extreme situations to have their gallbladder removed.\n\n\u201cThe patients feel like they\u2019re cured at first, and then the next time they eat red meat it happens again,\u201d he said.\n\nIs it treatable?\n\nWhile Commins said researchers are working on a cure or treatment plan, there is no cure currently available for those who are diagnosed with an alpha-gal meat allergy.\n\nThe most those with the allergy can do is to avoid red meat, which includes beef, lamb, pork, veal, goat, among others.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t all bad, though.\n\nWOMAN'S HOME INFESTED WITH TICKS AFTER 85 ARE FOUND ON FAMILY DOG\n\n\u201cThere is a bright spot in this; this is one of these food allergies that will resolve over time,\u201d he said, though he noted that additional tick bites may prolong the condition.\n\nCommins explained that the allergy cells responsible for the red meat allergy don't usually become long-lasting memory cells, unlike those associated with peanut and tree nut allergies.\n\n\u201cThe allergy can go away, it\u2019s not a lifelong thing,\u201d he said."
